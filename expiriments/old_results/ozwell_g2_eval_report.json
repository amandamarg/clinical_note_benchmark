The first note is more concise and focuses on the overall process and follow-up plan.","1":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same patient's medical history, diagnosis, and treatment plan. Both notes mention the patient's intractable right arm pain and swelling, the diagnosis of primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis, and the complications of thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. They also detail the patient's pain management regimen, including opioid therapy and the use of a brachial plexus block. The notes describe the same imaging and diagnostic studies, including the MRI of the brachial plexus and the diagnostic brachial plexus block. The plan for further evaluation and management is also consistent in both notes.","2":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same patient's clinical presentation, examination findings, investigations, management plan, surgical procedure, and current status. The details about the patient's condition, such as the chest pain, dyspnoea, hypertension, aortic root aneurysm, and aortic coarctation, are consistent across both notes. The surgical procedure and the outcome are also described in a similar manner. The main difference is in the level of detail and the structure of the notes, with the second note providing a more detailed account of the surgical procedure and postoperative course.","3":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same clinical case involving a patient with swelling in the right jaw due to Garre's osteomyelitis from a periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Both notes detail the patient's history, clinical examination findings, radiographic and cone-beam computed tomography findings, diagnosis, and treatment plan. The main difference is that the second note includes additional details about the patient's age, the outcome of the postoperative examination, and the patient's rural location and financial constraints affecting treatment decisions.","4":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same patient's medical history, symptoms, colonoscopy findings, treatment, and postoperative course. The details about the patient's past medical history, the findings during the colonoscopy, the decision for surgical intervention, and the postoperative outcome are consistent across both notes. The main difference is in the presentation and structure of the information, but the content and key details remain the same.","5":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same clinical scenario involving a patient with a mass on the left ring finger. Both notes include details about the patient's history, physical examination, radiologic evaluation, surgical intervention, and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the second note provides more detailed information about the surgical findings, histological assessment, and post-operative course.","6":"The two notes are essentially identical. They both describe the same clinical scenario involving a 77-year-old female patient with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, a history of squamous cell carcinoma, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Both notes detail the physical examination findings, imaging results, surgical intervention, and postoperative outcomes. The assessment and plan sections are also consistent, describing the diagnosis of a glomus tumor and the patient's satisfaction with the surgical results.","7":"The two notes are essentially identical. They both describe the same clinical scenario involving a 72-year-old male patient with bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. Both notes detail the patient's medical history of hypertension, the findings from physical and ultrasound examinations, Doppler ultrasonic examination, and CT angiography. They also mention the plan for treatment and the challenges faced in finding appropriate stents for the aneurysms. The additional findings regarding the absence of collagen tissue disease are also consistent in both notes.","8":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the dental history and treatment plan for a patient with a history of dental issues, including decay and fractured teeth. Both notes mention the patient's high risk for caries and eccentric bruxism, partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant, and the previous treatment with composite fillings and implants. They also detail the current findings of new and secondary subgingival caries, the poor conservative prognosis, and the patient's decision to opt for an implant-supported bridge. The treatment plan, including the extraction of lateral incisors, placement of immediate implants, preparation of residual teeth as abutments, and the eventual placement of a permanent bridge, is consistent in both notes. Additionally, both notes emphasize the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups.","9":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same patient's clinical presentation, history, workup, findings, and treatment plan for worsening chronic hypertension. Both notes mention the patient's history of hypertension managed with hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan, the recent increase in blood pressure, emergency department visits, and the findings of renal artery stenosis and significant aortic stenosis. They also describe the consultations, procedures, and the outcome after stenting.

They both describe the case of a 25-year-old male patient who experienced recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek due to a dislodged orthodontic appliance from a previous orthognathic surgery. Both notes mention the patient's fit and healthy status, lack of relevant medical history, and the absence of known allergies. They detail the history of the dislodged appliance, its confirmation through imaging, and the decision to leave it in place initially due to postoperative oedema. The notes also describe the examination findings, including the presence of a sinus track with pus discharge, and the plan to remove the appliance. The main difference is that the second note provides more detailed information about the surgical exploration and removal of the appliance, as well as the patient's recovery and follow-up with the surgical team.","11":"The two notes are quite similar in content, as they both describe a situation involving a woman with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who is the primary caregiver for her mother with end-stage breast cancer.
