Both notes describe the same patient case, including the discovery of a right adrenal lesion following slightly elevated liver enzymes, the findings from an abdominal ultrasound and MRI, and the endocrinological evaluation results. They both detail the surgical procedure of a right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy, including the positioning of the patient, the insertion of trocars, and the steps taken during the surgery. The plans in both notes involve post-operative monitoring and follow-up appointments. The main difference is the date and time of the notes, with the first note being more recent.","1":"The two clinical notes are very similar. Both notes describe the same patient with intractable right arm pain and swelling due to primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. They both mention the patient's history of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, complications with thrombocytopenia, and the determination that the patient is a non-surgical candidate.

Both notes describe the same patient case, including the presence of a sensitive mass on the right wrist that has been worsening over three years, hypersensitivity to light contact, and occasional radiating pain. Both notes mention the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), as well as the lack of relief from a stellate ganglion block and the slow improvement in range of motion with home exercises. The objective findings in both notes are identical, describing a small round nodule on the wrist with significant point tenderness and no Tinel\u2019s sign, and imaging showing diffuse osteopenia. The assessment in both notes concludes that the findings are consistent with a neuroma, and both notes describe the surgical excision of a maroon-colored mass, which was confirmed to be a glomus tumor. The plan in both notes includes the patient's satisfaction with the surgical results and a scheduled follow-up visit.","7":"The two clinical notes are nearly identical. They both describe the same patient case, including the chief complaint of bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand, the medical history of hypertension, and the absence of trauma. The physical examination findings, ultrasound examination results, Doppler ultrasonic examination, CT angiography findings, and additional findings are all the same in both notes.
