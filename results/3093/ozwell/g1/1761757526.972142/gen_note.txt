**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Susan  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mrs. Susan reports persistent pain throughout her body, with severe pain localized in her hands and legs. She has a history of carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand, which provided only temporary relief. She has tried various treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, but these have not been effective and, in some cases, exacerbated her pain. She also reports weakness in her legs, difficulty with bladder and bowel control, and frequent falls due to her legs giving out.

**Objective:**
Mrs. Susan underwent an MRI and emergency surgery in May 2011 to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. Post-surgery, she experienced paralysis on the right side of her body. A subsequent surgery in August 2012 aimed at pain relief resulted in increased pain. She currently receives weekly injections for pain relief, which provide only marginal benefit for a week. She is on high doses of medication for nerve pain relief, which also offer limited benefit. She has areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs, where even light touch, such as a bed sheet, causes pain.

**Assessment:**
Chronic pain with severe symptoms in hands and legs, history of cervical spine issues, and post-surgical complications. Limited response to current pain management strategies.

**Plan:**
1. Schedule imaging tests, including an MRI, to assess for spinal cord compression or other issues.
2. Conduct nerve tests to evaluate for potential nerve damage.
3. Follow up with Mrs. Susan to discuss test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.

**Follow-up:**
Mrs. Susan will be contacted to schedule the necessary tests and will return for a follow-up appointment to review the results and discuss further management options.
