**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:47:38 AM  
**Location:** Oral Surgery Clinic  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and swelling on the right cheek for the past three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient, a fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history or known allergies, reports experiencing pain and swelling on the right cheek for the past three months. He has visited a general practitioner several times and was prescribed analgesics and antibiotics, but symptoms persist. The patient had orthognathic surgery one and a half years ago, during which a dislodged orthodontic appliance was noted in the right cheek. The surgical team decided to leave it in-situ due to pronounced postoperative facial oedema and continued with clinical observation as there were no signs or symptoms during follow-up sessions.

**Examination:**  
- No extraoral swelling observed.
- Mandible and maxilla are firm.
- Sinus track with slight pus discharge noted on the upper right buccal sulcus region.
- Tenderness present upon palpation of the affected area.

**Assessment:**  
The sinus track is suspected to originate from the dislodged orthodontic appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue. A periapical view confirmed the presence of the appliance causing the pain and swelling.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule an appointment for the removal of the dislodged appliance.
- Follow-up appointment in one week.
- Advise the patient to keep the area clean and avoid strenuous activities.

**Follow-Up:**  
Patient to return in one week for follow-up after the removal procedure.
