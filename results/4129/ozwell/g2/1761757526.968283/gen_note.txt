**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Time:** 3:05 PM  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Doctor:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Evaluation of worsening chronic hypertension

**History:**
The patient has a 10-year history of hypertension, managed with hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan. Recently, the patient's systolic blood pressure has exceeded 200 mmHg, leading to an emergency department visit for headache and malaise. The patient was treated and discharged but returned five days later with difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in the lower extremities. Blood pressure at that time was 216/81 mmHg.

**Workup:**
- No acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis was found.
- Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction.
- Despite medical therapy, including five antihypertensive agents and an esmolol infusion, blood pressure remained refractory.
- Renal artery ultrasound indicated renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left.
- No history of kidney disease or elevated creatinine levels.

**Consultations and Findings:**
- Vascular surgery consultation revealed weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit. Ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred, and an angiogram was scheduled.
- Aortography showed widely patent renal arteries but significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta.
- Stenosis was greater than 90%, with a pressure gradient between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements exceeding 100 mmHg.
- CTA confirmed stenosis 1.3 cm proximal to the celiac origin, measuring 5 mm.

**Plan:**
The patient will be followed up regularly, and a multidisciplinary team will be consulted to develop a comprehensive management plan. Further interventions will be considered based on the extent of the stenosis and the patient's response to ongoing treatment.
