**Chief Complaint:**  
Worsening chronic hypertension.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents for evaluation of worsening chronic hypertension. The patient has been on hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan for 10 years. Recently, the patient's systolic blood pressure has been exceeding 200 mmHg, leading to treatment in the emergency department for headache and malaise. The patient was treated and discharged but returned to the emergency department 5 days later with difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in the lower extremities. On presentation, the blood pressure was 216/81 mmHg. The patient was admitted, and the workup demonstrated no acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis. Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a preserved ejection fraction. Despite medical therapy, the patient's blood pressure remained refractory, even with five antihypertensive agents and an esmolol infusion.

A renal artery ultrasound showed renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left. The patient has no history of kidney disease and no elevation of creatinine. Vascular surgery consultation revealed weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit. Ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred, and the patient was scheduled for an angiogram.

The patient underwent aortography, which showed the renal arteries to be widely patent but significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta. The degree of stenosis was greater than 90%, and the pressure gradient between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements exceeded 100 mmHg. A CTA confirmed a stenosis 1.3 cm proximal to the celiac origin measuring 5 mm.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Worsening chronic hypertension with significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta.
- Consult with specialists to develop a comprehensive management plan.
- Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the patient's condition and response to treatment.
