**Chief Complaint:**  
Worsening chronic hypertension.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents for evaluation of worsening chronic hypertension. The patient has been on hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan for 10 years. Recently, the patient's systolic blood pressure has been exceeding 200 mmHg, leading to treatment in the emergency department for headache and malaise. The patient was treated and discharged but returned to the emergency department 5 days later with difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in the lower extremities. On presentation, the blood pressure was 216/81 mmHg. Despite medical therapy, including five antihypertensive agents and an esmolol infusion, the blood pressure remained refractory.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Chronic hypertension

**Medications:**  
- Hydrochlorothiazide  
- Valsartan  

**Emergency Department Visits:**  
- Initial visit for headache and malaise  
- Follow-up visit for difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in lower extremities  

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
- No acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis on workup  
- Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction  
- Renal artery ultrasound showed renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left  
- Aortography revealed widely patent renal arteries but significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta  
- Degree of stenosis greater than 90% with a pressure gradient between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements exceeding 100 mmHg  
- CTA confirmed stenosis 1.3 cm proximal to the celiac origin measuring 5 mm  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Weak but palpable femoral pulses  
- Audible abdominal aortic bruit  

**Consultations:**  
- Vascular surgery consulted; ankle-brachial index measurements deferred, scheduled for angiogram  

**Plan:**  
Consultation with specialists to develop a comprehensive management plan. The patient is advised to follow up regularly for ongoing evaluation and management of hypertension and associated complications.
