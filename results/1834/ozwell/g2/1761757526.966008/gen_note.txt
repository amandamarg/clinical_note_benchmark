**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Doctor:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a sensitive mass on the right wrist, which has been progressively worsening over the past three years. The patient reports hypersensitivity to light contact and occasional pain radiating down the ulnar aspect of the wrist. There is no cold sensitivity associated with the mass. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsal-radial aspect of the hand, which was treated, but resulted in reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) causing delayed recovery in range of motion. A stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for the RSD, but the range of motion has been slowly improving with home exercises.

**Objective:**  
During the physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness without radiation or Tinelâ€™s sign. Imaging showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.

**Assessment:**  
The location and exam findings were consistent with a neuroma evolving from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. During surgery, a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was found connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. The diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor, confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin.

**Plan:**  
The patient reported no pain and was very satisfied with the surgical results at the first postoperative visit. The situation will be monitored for any complications. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit in one week.
