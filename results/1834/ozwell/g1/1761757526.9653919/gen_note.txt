**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:47:28 AM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports a sensitive mass on the right wrist, which has been present and progressively worsening over the past three years. The patient describes hypersensitivity to light contact and occasional pain radiating down the ulnar aspect of the wrist. There is no cold sensitivity associated with the mass. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsal-radial aspect of the hand, which was treated. However, the patient developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) as a result, leading to delayed recovery in the range of motion. A stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for the RSD, but the range of motion has been slowly progressing with home exercises.

**Objective:**  
During the physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness without radiation or Tinelâ€™s sign. Imaging showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.

**Assessment:**  
The location and exam findings are consistent with a neuroma that evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. 

**Plan:**  
The patient was taken to the operative theater for a deep dissection, where a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was found connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At the first postoperative visit, the patient reported no pain and was very satisfied with the surgical results. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor, confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin. The patient is advised to return for a follow-up visit in a week to monitor for any complications. 

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return in one week for a follow-up visit to ensure there are no complications.
