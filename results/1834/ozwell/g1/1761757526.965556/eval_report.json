The patient describes hypersensitivity to light contact and occasional radiating pain down the ulnar aspect of the wrist. There is no cold sensitivity associated with the mass. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsal-radial aspect of the hand, which was treated. However, the patient developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) as a result, leading to delayed recovery in the range of motion. A stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for the RSD, but the range of motion has been slowly progressing with home exercises.\n\n**Objective:**  \nDuring the physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness without radiation or Tinel\u2019s sign. Imaging showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe location and exam findings are consistent with a neuroma that evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. During surgery, a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was found connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. The diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor, confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin.\n\n**Plan:**  \nThe patient reported no pain and was very satisfied with the results of the surgery at the first postoperative visit. The situation will be monitored to ensure no complications arise. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit in a week.",

        "standard_note":"A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel\u2019s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch. The nerve and mass were excised and sent for histopathological review. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were visualized and confirmed to have no involvement with the mass. At her first postoperative visit, she reported no pain and that she was very satisfied with the results of her surgery. Diagnostic pathological stains were consistent with a glomus tumor. This was confirmed with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin (Figures , ).",
        "ozwell-s1":"The two notes are essentially identical. They both describe the same clinical scenario involving a 77-year-old female patient with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, a history of squamous cell carcinoma, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Both notes detail the physical examination findings, the surgical procedure performed, and the postoperative results, including the diagnosis of a glomus tumor. The wording and structure of the notes are the same, indicating they are duplicates.",
