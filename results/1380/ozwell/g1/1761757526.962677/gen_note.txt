**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:46:26 AM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling in the right jaw.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a swelling in the right jaw, which developed three months ago due to an infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but the treatment was ineffective. The patient has no past or congenital diseases specified in their medical history.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- Severe swelling in the right jaw without fluctuation upon palpation.  
- Submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region.  
- Normal skin color and appearance.  

**Oral Examination:**  
- Right mandibular first molar tooth with a deep caries cavity, not mobile.  

**Radiographic Examination:**  
- Deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- Lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible and at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation.  

**Cone-Beam Computed Tomography:**  
- Tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center at the lower edge of the mandible and the vestibule surface in this region.  

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the findings, the pathologic lesion was diagnosed as Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Treatment Plan:**  
Endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, due to the patient's location in a remote rural area and the prohibitive cost of such treatment, the patient was transferred to the surgical clinic. The most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction.
