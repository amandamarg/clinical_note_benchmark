**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:46:20 AM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling in the right jaw.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a swelling in the right jaw, which has been present for three months. The swelling developed due to an infection and was initially treated with antibiotics, which were ineffective. The patient has no past or congenital diseases specified in their medical history.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- **General Appearance:** Skin color and appearance were normal.  
- **Palpation:** Severe swelling without fluctuation upon palpation.  
- **Lymphadenopathy:** Submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region.  

**Oral Examination:**  
- The right mandibular first molar tooth had a deep caries cavity and was not mobile.

**Radiographic Examination:**  
- A deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area were observed in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- A lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible and at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, indicating focal new bone formation.

**Cone-Beam Computed Tomography:**  
- Identified a tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone on the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- Bone deposition was noted at the radiolucent area in the center at the lower edge of the mandible and the vestibule surface in this region.

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the findings, the pathologic lesion was diagnosed as Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Treatment Plan:**  
Endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth. However, due to the patient's remote rural location and the prohibitive cost of such treatment, the patient was transferred to the surgical clinic. The most appropriate treatment method was determined to be dental extraction.
