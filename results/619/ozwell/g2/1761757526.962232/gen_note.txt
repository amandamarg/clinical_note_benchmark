**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]
- **Date:** 10/9/2025
- **Presenting Complaint:** Chest pain and dyspnoea

**History:**
- The patient was referred for evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath.
- No pre-existing medical conditions reported.

**Examination Findings:**
- Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses.
- Hypertension with marked differences in systolic blood pressure between upper (190mmHg) and lower limbs (75mmHg).
- Ankle brachial index: 0.39.

**Investigations:**
- **Electrocardiogram:** Severe left ventricular hypertrophy.
- **Echocardiography:** Tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation; aortic root aneurysm (~9 cm); preserved left ventricular function.
- **CT Angiography:** Aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm); severe aortic coarctation with subtotal occlusion (lumen <6 mm) distal to the left subclavian artery; collateral circulation noted.
- **Coronary Angiography:** Right dominant coronary system; no significant coronary disease.

**Management Plan:**
- Initial plan for a two-staged hybrid approach: endovascular stenting of coarctation followed by surgical repair of aortic root aneurysm.
- Endovascular approach via femoral route was unsuccessful due to complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus.
- Decision made for a single-stage surgical approach to address both aortic root aneurysm and coarctation.

**Surgical Procedure:**
- Arterial lines placed in left radial and left femoral artery.
- Right infraclavicular and right groin incisions made for peripheral arterial cannulation to right axillary and right femoral artery.
- Aorta repaired using an 8 mm dacron graft.

**Current Status:**
- Patient is in stable condition post-surgery.
- Close monitoring required over the next few days.
- Follow-up appointments and tests will be necessary.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring and provide supportive care.
- Schedule follow-up appointments for further evaluation and management. 

**Doctor's Notes:**
- Patient advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately.
