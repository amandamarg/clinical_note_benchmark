**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:47:10 AM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]  
- **Age:** [Patient's Age]  
- **Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports being asymptomatic with no physical exam abnormalities. The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound due to slightly elevated liver enzymes found during a routine blood test.  

**Objective:**  
- **Ultrasound Findings:** Right adrenal lesion of 9 cm diameter.  
- **MRI Findings:** Soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm originating from the right adrenal gland.  
- **Endocrinological Evaluation:** Normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hypersecretion of catecholamines.  
- **Adrenal Scan:** Well encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications, without local invasion.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a right adrenal mass with no evidence of local invasion or hormonal hypersecretion.  

**Plan:**  
The decision was made to proceed with a right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy.  

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia administered after central and arterial lines insertion.  
- **Position:** Left decubitus position.  
- **Trocars:**  
  - First 12-mm port at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle above the umbilicus for the camera.  
  - Two subcostal 11 mm ports: one in the midclavicular line and the other at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle.  
  - Fourth 5-mm subcostal trocar in the anterior axillary line for liver retraction.  
  - Fifth 5-mm trocar in the epigastrium for aspiration and irrigation.  
- **Procedure Details:**  
  - Liver retraction followed by incision of the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC to expose it below its intrahepatic course.  
  - Mobilization of the duodenum diverted by the mass.  
  - Dissection carried inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein.  
  - Careful dissection of the mass, particularly at the medial aspect.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored post-operatively and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and any further treatment needs.
