**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 11/13/2025  
**Time:** 6:26:26 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Bipolar Affective Disorder  
- **Current Medication:** Olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day)  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Discomfort in neck and lower back  
- Inability to maintain an erect posture  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with discomfort in the neck and lower back, reporting an inability to maintain an erect posture. The patient experiences a tendency to fall to either side when standing up from a sitting position, with the head consistently turned to the right and upwards. The patient reports pain and discomfort in the neck, with sideways bending in the lumbar region. To counteract the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, the patient maintains specific limb positions to support body weight. These restrictions significantly affect daily life, requiring assistance for standing, walking, and self-care activities.  

The patient has been experiencing these difficulties for the past four months, coinciding with the introduction of olanzapine tablets for exacerbated mental illness. The patient was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder seven years ago, with the first episode of mania occurring at age eleven. The patient has been on olanzapine for seven years, with doses ranging from 2.5-10 mg per day. The neck pain and discomfort developed within the second week of starting olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day, characterized by sustained and abnormal contraction of neck muscles pulling the head to the right and upwards. These symptoms have persisted for the first three years of the illness with varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction, correlating with the olanzapine dose.  

Apart from a brief period of around three weeks when the patient was prescribed trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for upper limb rigidity, which showed a good response, no other psychotropic medications have been prescribed.  

**Plan:**  
- Order diagnostic tests to further evaluate the patient's condition.  
- Provide instructions on follow-up requirements.
