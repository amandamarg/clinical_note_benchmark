**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 11/13/2025  
**Time:** 6:26:49 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Bipolar Affective Disorder  
- **Medication:** Olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day), Trihexyphenidyl (4 mg/day for a brief period)

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Discomfort in neck and lower back  
- Inability to maintain an erect posture  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with discomfort in the neck and lower back, reporting an inability to maintain an erect posture. The patient experiences a tendency to fall to either side when standing up from a sitting position, with the head consistently turned to the right and upwards. The patient reports pain and discomfort in the neck, alongside a sideways bending in the lumbar region. To counteract the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, the patient maintains specific limb positions to support body weight. These symptoms have been present for the past four months, coinciding with the introduction of olanzapine tablets for exacerbated mental illness.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder seven years ago.  
- First episode of affective disorder was mania at age eleven.  
- On olanzapine for seven years, with symptoms developing within the second week of a 5 mg/day dose.  
- Symptoms of sustained and abnormal neck muscle contraction pulling the head to the right and upwards have persisted for the first three years of illness with varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction, correlating with the dose of olanzapine.  
- Brief period of trihexyphenidyl 4 mg/day for upper limb rigidity, which showed a good response.

**Impact on Daily Life:**  
The patient requires assistance with standing and walking and needs parental help with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.

**Plan:**  
- Order tests to provide a proper diagnosis.  
- Instruct the patient on follow-up requirements.
