**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 11/13/2025  
**Time:** 6:23:36 PM  
**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Physician:** [Name Redacted]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Discomfort in neck and lower back, inability to maintain an erect posture.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with discomfort in the neck and lower back, reporting an inability to maintain an erect posture. The patient experiences a tendency to fall to either side when standing up from a sitting position, with the head consistently turned to the right and upwards. The patient reports pain and discomfort in the neck, with sideways bending in the lumbar region. To counteract the abnormal positioning of the back and neck, the patient maintains specific limb positions to support body weight. These symptoms have been present for the past four months, coinciding with the introduction of olanzapine tablets for exacerbated mental illness. The patient requires assistance with standing, walking, and daily self-care activities.

**Past Medical History:**  
Diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder seven years ago. The first episode was mania at age eleven. The patient has been on olanzapine tablets, with doses ranging from 2.5-10 mg per day at different times. Pain and discomfort in the neck developed within the second week of starting olanzapine at a dose of 5 mg per day. The sustained and abnormal contraction of neck muscles pulls the head to the right in an upward direction. These symptoms have persisted for the first three years of the illness with varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction, correlating with the dose of olanzapine.

**Medications:**  
- Olanzapine 2.5-10 mg per day (current dose 5 mg per day)
- Trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day (brief period of around three weeks for upper limb rigidity, showed good response)

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Order diagnostic tests to further evaluate the patient's condition.
- Follow-up instructions will be provided after test results are reviewed.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be instructed on follow-up requirements after the completion of diagnostic tests.
