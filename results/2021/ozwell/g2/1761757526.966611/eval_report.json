        "standard_note":"The 72 year old male patient was referred to our clinic with the complaint of bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. In his medical history, he had hypertension for 4 years but no history of trauma. A physical examination showed the presence of palpable pulsatile masses in his both axillae (12 cm in size in the right axilla and 8 cm in size in the left axilla) (Fig. ). His neurological and systemic examinations were within normal limits. An upper-extremity ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysm in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, reaching 67 \u00d7 45 mm in dimension. There was a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen. Adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a 48 \u00d7 40 mm hyperechogenic mass not related to the aneurysm. There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 \u00d7 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus. A Doppler ultrasonic examination revealed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery. There was no blood flow in the region adjacent to the right axillary artery (Figs. and ). On CT angiography, giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 \u00d7 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 \u00d7 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen. There was also an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture. A physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints revealed no signs of collagen tissue disease, nor was it detected through laboratory examinations. Because the patient was symptomatic and had a high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate size stents could not be found for aneurysms so large and tortuous. Besides, the long-term success of the stenting procedure could not be guaranteed due to the large sizes and high mobility of the aneurysms, so the patient was referred for surgery.",
        "ozwell-s1":"The two notes are very similar. They both describe the same clinical case of a 72-year-old male patient with bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. Both notes detail the patient's medical history of hypertension, the findings from physical and ultrasound examinations, and the results of Doppler ultrasonic and CT angiography. They also mention the plan for endovascular closure, the issue with finding appropriate size stents, and the follow-up appointment. The main difference is that the second note includes more detailed descriptions and additional information, such as the presence of a hyperechogenic mass adjacent to the right axillary artery and the referral for surgery due to the large size and high mobility of the aneurysms.",
