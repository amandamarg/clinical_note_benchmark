Doctor: Good morning, what brings you here today?
Patient: Good morning doctor, I was referred to your clinic with the complaint of bilateral axillary masses and numbness in my right hand.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me a little more about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have had hypertension for 4 years but no history of trauma.
Doctor: Okay, and what happened during your physical examination?
Patient: The examination showed the presence of palpable pulsatile masses in both my axillae. They were 12 cm in size in my right axilla and 8 cm in size in my left axilla.
Doctor: I see. And what did the ultrasound examination reveal?
Patient: An aneurysm was found in a 12-cm segment of the right axillary artery, and it was 67 × 45 mm in dimension. There was also a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen.
Doctor: Hmm, and what about the left axillary artery?
Patient: There was also an aneurysm reaching 40 × 43 mm in dimension in a 9-cm segment of the left axillary artery, with a 17-mm thick thrombus.
Doctor: Okay, and what did the Doppler ultrasonic examination show?
Patient: The examination showed a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center. The aneurysmal segment was continuous with the brachial artery.
Doctor: I see. And what did the CT angiography show?
Patient: Giant fusiform aneurysms were detected, measuring 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery and 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery. There were thrombi in both aneurysms, allowing the flow in the lumen.
Doctor: Hmm, and what were the findings?
Patient: There was an extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm. These latter findings were proposed to be due to a spontaneously healed rupture.
Doctor: I see. And did the physical examination of the eyes, bones, skin and joints reveal any signs of collagen tissue disease?
Patient: No, there were no signs detected through the examination or laboratory examinations.
Doctor: Okay. Because you are symptomatic and have a high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate size stents could not be found for aneurysms so large and tortuous.
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Alright, I will instruct you on follow-up requirements. Please come back in a week for a check-up.
Patient: Okay, thank you doctor.
