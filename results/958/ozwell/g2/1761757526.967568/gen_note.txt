**Clinical Note:**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Subject:** Follow-up on Dental Treatment and Current Complaint

**History:**
The patient presented with a complaint of pain in the upper left canine, persisting for a few weeks, particularly when chewing or biting. The patient has a history of dental issues, including decay and fractured teeth, and was previously treated for fractured central incisors three years ago.

**Previous Treatment:**
- Composite fillings were placed on the upper front teeth.
- Posterior superior quadrants were restored with implants.
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism was identified.
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant was noted.

**Current Findings:**
- New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth.
- Conservative prognosis is poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay from canine to canine.

**Treatment Plan:**
- The patient opted for an implant-supported bridge to replace residual teeth, similar to previous satisfactory prostheses.
- Treatment was staged:
  - Lateral incisors were extracted, and two immediate implants were placed.
  - Four residual teeth were prepared as abutments for a temporary bridge.
  - Subsequently, the four remaining teeth were extracted, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.
  - Root canal treatment was needed for one abutment tooth due to a periapical infection.

**Current Status:**
- The two implants have osseointegrated well.
- The patient is ready for the placement of a permanent bridge.

**Plan:**
- Schedule an appointment for the placement of the permanent bridge next week.
- Advise the patient to maintain good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue monitoring for any signs of infection or complications.
- Reinforce the importance of oral hygiene to prevent further decay.

**Follow-up:**
- Appointment scheduled for next week for the placement of the permanent bridge.
