**Patient:** [Patient's Name]

**Chief Complaint:** Pain in upper left canine.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient reports experiencing pain in the upper left canine for a few weeks, particularly when chewing or biting. The patient has a history of dental decay and fractured teeth.

**Past Dental History:** 
- Three years ago, the patient presented with fractured central incisors and received composite fillings for the upper front teeth.
- The posterior superior quadrants were restored with implants, which the patient found highly satisfactory.
- The patient has a history of high risk for caries, eccentric bruxism, and partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.

**Recent Findings:** 
- New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis is poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay from canine to canine.

**Treatment Plan Discussed and Agreed Upon:**
- Replacement of residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge, similar to the posterior prostheses.
- Treatment was carried out in stages:
  - Extraction of lateral incisors and placement of two immediate implants.
  - Preparation of four residual teeth as abutments for a temporary bridge.
  - Subsequent extraction of the four remaining teeth and replacement of the initial provisional bridge with a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.
  - Root canal treatment was needed for one out of the four abutment teeth due to a periapical infection.

**Current Status:** The two implants have osseointegrated well, and the patient is now ready for the placement of a permanent bridge.

**Plan:** Schedule an appointment for the placement of the permanent bridge next week. Emphasize the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups.
