**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:48:17 AM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain in the upper left canine.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the upper left canine for a few weeks, particularly when chewing or biting. The patient has a history of dental decay and fractured teeth.

**Past Dental History:**  
Three years ago, the patient presented with fractured central incisors and received composite fillings for the upper front teeth. The posterior superior quadrants were restored with implants. The patient has a high risk for caries and eccentric bruxism, and partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.

**Recent Findings:**  
New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis is poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay from canine to canine.

**Treatment Plan:**  
After discussing treatment options, the patient opted for a new implant-supported bridge, similar to the previously performed prostheses in the posterior areas, which were highly satisfactory. The treatment was carried out in stages:

1. Extraction of lateral incisors and placement of two immediate implants.
2. Preparation of the four residual teeth to serve as abutments for a temporary bridge.
3. Extraction of the four remaining teeth and replacement of the initial provisional bridge with a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one out of the four abutment teeth required root canal treatment due to a periapical infection.

**Current Status:**  
The two implants have osseointegrated well, and the patient is now ready for the placement of a permanent bridge.

**Plan:**  
Schedule an appointment for the placement of the permanent bridge next week. The patient is advised to maintain good oral hygiene and continue with regular dental check-ups.

**Follow-Up:**  
Appointment scheduled for next week for the placement of the permanent bridge.
