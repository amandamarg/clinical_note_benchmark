**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits for the past 6 months. They reported more frequent stools and the passage of mucus. The patient denied any abdominal pain. 

**Medical History:**  
- Born with bladder exstrophy; multiple surgeries including cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5.  
- Recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood.  
- No other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy.  
- No family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
Colonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, approximately 3 cm each, with a type IV pit pattern and areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. Histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion. The mucosa around a diverticulum-like structure was atypical but not adenomatous. No other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere in the colon.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Endoscopic resection was considered but surgery was preferred due to characteristics and difficult endoscopic access. Radiological imaging suggested possible invasive disease due to sigmoid thickening.
- The patient underwent a high anterior resection with an open approach due to suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request.
- During laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind-ending tube was noted from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon, marked for pathological identification.
- The patient had an uneventful recovery and reports good quality of life post-surgery. The decision for a permanent colostomy was patient-driven.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to return for any future questions or concerns.
