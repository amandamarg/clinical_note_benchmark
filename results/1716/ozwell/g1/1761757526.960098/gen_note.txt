**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Visit Type:** Follow-up for intractable pain management

**Chief Complaint:**  
Intractable right arm pain and swelling for the past 10 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to our clinic for management of intractable pain. The patient has been experiencing right arm pain and swelling for the past 10 months. A computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast performed in the emergency department revealed two masses in the right axillary and supraclavicular regions. The patient was diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which were complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a non-surgical candidate.

The patient's pain has been worsening despite opioid therapy and titration of oral medications. The pain is described as a constant 10/10 on the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. It is dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature, and worsens with passive and active range of motion. At its best, the pain is a 7/10 with oral medications. The patient also reports progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity.

A magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords, as well as the right brachial artery. A diagnostic brachial plexus block was performed in the hospital due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. However, the brachial plexus could not be visualized using ultrasonography due to tumor effect in the classic supraclavicular area.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
1. **Intractable Pain:** The patient's pain is severe and not adequately controlled with current oral medications. I will review the patient's medical records and recommend additional tests and treatments to help manage the pain.
2. **Metastatic Primary Mammary Carcinoma:** Continue to monitor the progression of the disease and coordinate with oncology for ongoing management.
3. **Functional Decline:** Address the progressive weakness of the right upper extremity and consider further interventions to improve function.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to return in one week to discuss the results of the review and next steps in the management plan.
