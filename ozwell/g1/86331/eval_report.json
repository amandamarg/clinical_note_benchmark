Both notes discuss her recurrent ischemic colitis, the findings from CT scans showing chronic B-AD, and the plan to perform TEVAR to improve blood flow to the SMA. The main difference is that the clinical note is a concise summary, while the detailed case description provides more in-depth information about the procedures and outcomes."}}
