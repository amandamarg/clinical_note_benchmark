**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:30 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Maintenance hemodialysis for 26 years  
- **Surgical History:** Total arch replacement 8 years ago; Bentall procedure 7 years ago for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection  
- **Current Issue:** Recurrent ischemic colitis  

**History and Findings:**  
The patient reports worsening abdominal pain that is intermittent. The patient has a history of total arch replacement and Bentall procedure, with remaining dissections on the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. The aorta's diameter has remained stable without enlargement. One year ago, the patient experienced initial abdominal pain with ischemic colitis, and a colonoscopy revealed a white coating near the Bauhin valve and localized distorted ulcers in the ascending colon, without mucosal necrosis. Symptoms were slight and temporary, managed with conservative treatments. Recently, the patient has experienced worsening abdominal pain and frequent melena, particularly when blood pressure drops during hemodialysis.

The patient was referred for further evaluation of recurrent ischemic colitis. CT scans showed chronic B-AD extending from the distal anastomotic part of the total arch graft to both common iliac arteries, with a distal re-entry size of 26 mm. The expanded false lumen compresses the true lumen of most of the aorta, including the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).

**Assessment:**  
Recurrent ischemic colitis is likely due to diminished blood flow to the SMA from the compressed true lumen, combined with hypotension during hemodialysis. The patient's quality of life is adversely affected.

**Plan:**  
Therapeutic enlargement of the true lumen is necessary to improve blood flow to the SMA and reduce ischemic colitis risk. TEVAR is planned as the treatment approach, given the risks associated with open surgical repair due to the patient's history of Bentall operation and comorbid ESRF. The procedure will be scheduled as soon as possible. In the interim, the patient is advised to monitor symptoms and blood pressure closely. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress.
