Both notes detail the patient's history, including the initial surgeries that were terminated due to bleeding, the subsequent increase in swelling, and the eventual diagnosis and treatment plan. They both mention the imaging studies performed, the findings of the cerebral MR angiography and conventional cerebral angiography, and the surgical procedure undertaken to remove the AVM. The notes also include the patient's subjective complaints, objective findings, assessment, and plan for follow-up. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, but the core information is consistent across both notes."}}
