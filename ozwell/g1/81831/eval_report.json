Both notes mention his previous medical conditions, the decision to proceed with surgery after a decline in his condition, and the use of vancomycin powder during surgery to minimize infection risk. They also both discuss the patient's postoperative condition and follow-up plans. The main difference is in the format and specific details included, such as the clinical note's structured format with headings like \"Subjective,\" \"Objective,\" \"Assessment/Plan,\" and \"Follow-Up.\""}}
