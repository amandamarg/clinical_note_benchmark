**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Y  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Urinary retention.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. X presented to the emergency department with urinary retention and required catheterization. Post-catheterization, he experienced gross hematuria.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Dual pancreas and kidney transplant 16 years ago due to end-stage renal disease secondary to type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
- Stable graft function since transplant; no longer requires insulin.  
- Complications from type 1 diabetes include retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.  
- Underwent colonoscopy a year ago for unintended weight loss, which revealed no visual abnormalities.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital signs stable.  
- No signs of infection.  
- Suprapubic tenderness noted.

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**  
- Serum creatinine: 114 Î¼mol/L with an estimated GFR of 60.  
- No abnormalities in the rest of the blood work.  
- Flexible cystoscopy identified a lesion highly suspicious for urothelial carcinoma at the ureteral orifice, possibly originating from the transplant ureter or transplant junction.  
- A false passage in the urethra likely from past catheter insertion was noted.  
- Follow-up CT scan showed no hydronephrosis or urothelial thickening in the transplanted kidney.  
- No mass lesion in the bladder identified, but mild thickening in the dome of the bladder suspected to be inflammatory changes due to pancreatic duct dilatation.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The findings on cystoscopy suggest a lesion suspicious for urothelial carcinoma.  
- A transurethral resection of the bladder tumor is recommended.  
- Patient has been counseled regarding treatment options and informed consent obtained for the procedure.  
- Antirejection medications have been modified in anticipation of the upcoming surgery.  
- Appropriate antibiotics have been administered.

**Follow-Up:**  
Will continue to monitor the patient and provide further updates as necessary. Mr. X is advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
