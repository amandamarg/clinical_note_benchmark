Both describe the patient's history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and the presentation of progressive, bilateral, lower extremity numbness that began in the feet, worsening with prolonged standing or walking, along with lower back pain. They both mention the MRI findings of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and the initial suspicion of neurosarcoidosis, with a negative lumbar puncture. Both notes discuss the spinal imaging suggesting a possible dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) and the subsequent catheter angiogram that revealed a dAVF at the right T7 spinal artery. The notes also describe the dual origin of the left vertebral artery and the embolization procedure performed on the right T7 spinal artery. The follow-up plan to monitor the condition is also mentioned in both notes."}}
