Both describe the case of a 47-year-old man with a soft tissue growth in the palate, detailing the history, clinical examination, radiographic findings, assessment, and plan for surgery. They both mention the rapid growth of the tissue, the initial lack of pain followed by mild pain, and the findings from the panoramic radiograph and CBCT scan. The surgical plan and the histopathological examination results are also consistent between the two notes."}}
