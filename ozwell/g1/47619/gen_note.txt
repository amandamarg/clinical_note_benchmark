**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Not Provided]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Referred by dentist for evaluation of a soft tissue growth in the palate.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a soft tissue growth in the palate that has been present for the past two months. The growth started suddenly and has grown rapidly in size. Initially, there was no pain, but the patient has experienced mild pain for the past week.

**Clinical Examination:**  
Upon examination, there is a diffuse, proliferative soft tissue growth in the maxilla extending from the marginal gingiva in the palatal aspect of the anterior tooth and involving the entire surface of the hard palate up to the level of the hard and soft palate junction. Erythema of attached gingiva is noted in relation to posterior teeth palatally and buccally. Grade III mobility is observed in all the anterior and posterior maxillary teeth.

**Radiographic Findings:**  
A previously taken panoramic radiograph showed severe bone loss in relation to maxillary teeth, suggestive of generalized periodontitis, but was inconclusive for other findings except for a root stump in the lower right quadrant. A CBCT scan revealed a moth-eaten appearance of the palate bilaterally with involvement of the nasopalatine canal anteriorly and external resorption of roots in relation to all the maxillary teeth present. There is evidence of involvement of the anterior and middle ethmoidal sinus, eustachian tube, and nasopharynx on the right side.

**Assessment:**  
Based on the CBCT and clinical findings, there is a suspicion of intraosseous malignancy involving the palate.

**Plan:**  
Recommend surgery for excision biopsy and total maxillectomy up to the floor of the orbit. The procedure will involve making an incision in the mouth to remove the growth and all the tissue up to the specified area. Post-surgery, the tissue will be sent to the lab for testing, and further treatment will be determined based on the results.
