**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:13 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with complaints of sickle cell pain, primarily severe pain in the left ankle, which has been ongoing for 2 years. The patient has a history of sickle cell disease and has been treated with opioids for pain management. The patient also reported a past medical history of osteomyelitis in the right arm 12 years ago, which was resolved with intravenous antibiotics. Additionally, the patient underwent a splenectomy 4 years ago to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to congenital hemolytic anemia.

**Objective:**  
The patient was referred for a bone scan and infection imaging. A plain radiograph of the left foot was normal. However, SPECT-CT showed increased uptake in the shoulders, knees, and sternum on blood pool and delayed images, consistent with marrow expansion. The bone marrow study confirmed bone marrow expansion around the large joints. There was increased blood pool and bone uptake in the left ankle, involving the proximal talus and the region of the medial malleolus, with a focal increased uptake in the left talus. This activity corresponded to a round lucent area surrounded by a dense sclerotic rim and sinus tract formation, together with a fracture line in the proximal talus on CT. The WBC scan showed no significant uptake, but the bone marrow scan showed asymmetrical uptake between the two ankles, without a cold lesion in the left talus, consistent with moderate bone marrow expansion.

**Assessment:**  
The findings from the CT and bone scan suggest a Brodie's abscess in the proximal left talus with possible surrounding chronic osteomyelitis.

**Plan:**  
The patient was initially started on intravenous antibiotics for 10 days, but there was no response. Subsequently, the abscess was treated with surgical curettage under general anesthesia, followed by continued antibiotic administration for 10 days. At 18 months post-removal of the abscess, the patient reported no pain or swelling at the site of the abscess, even during sickle cell VOC. Continued monitoring is advised, and the patient is instructed to return if any symptoms arise.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to return for monitoring and to report any recurrence of symptoms.
