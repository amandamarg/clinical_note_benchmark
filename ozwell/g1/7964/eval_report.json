Both describe the medical history and current condition of a young girl with recurrent episodes of left peripheral facial palsy. They detail her past medical history, including the diagnosis of pure red cell hypoplasia, episodes of facial palsy, and a hemorrhagic stroke. Both notes mention the use of corticosteroids for treatment and the resolution of symptoms. The chief complaint, history of present illness, and past medical history sections are consistent across both notes. The main difference is that the clinical note includes specific details about the patient's age and the timeline of events, while the second note is a more structured medical record format."}}
