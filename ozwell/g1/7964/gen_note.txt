**Chief Complaint:**  
Referred for observation due to left peripheral facial palsy.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with left peripheral facial palsy, characterized by difficulty closing the left eye and drooping of the mouth on the left side. The patient has a history of similar episodes, with the first occurrence at age three, which resolved after corticosteroid treatment. The patient was later diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia at age three years and nine months, presenting with severe anemia, low hemoglobin levels, and low red blood cell count. The suspected cause was anti-EPO antibodies, although these were not detected in the blood.

At age four years and four months, the patient experienced a second episode of left facial palsy and left-sided body weakness, with imaging revealing a hemorrhagic stroke. The patient also had high blood pressure during hospitalization. Symptoms resolved completely three weeks later.

A third episode of left peripheral facial palsy occurred at age five years and six months. Brain MRI showed evolution of the previous hemorrhagic insult without new lesions. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, resulting in symptom resolution.

**Past Medical History:**  
- First episode of left peripheral facial palsy at age three, resolved with corticosteroids.
- Diagnosed with pure red cell hypoplasia at age three years and nine months.
- Second episode of left facial palsy and left-sided weakness at age four years and four months, associated with a hemorrhagic stroke.
- Third episode of left peripheral facial palsy at age five years and six months, treated with corticosteroids.

**Medications:**  
- Corticosteroids (previously used for treatment of facial palsy episodes)

**Allergies:**  
- No known drug allergies.

**Family History:**  
- Not discussed.

**Social History:**  
- Not discussed.

**Review of Systems:**  
- Positive for difficulty closing left eye and drooping of the mouth on the left side.

**Physical Examination:**  
- To be conducted.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has a recurrent history of left peripheral facial palsy with associated neurological events. Further examination and tests are necessary to determine the best course of treatment. Consideration of corticosteroid therapy may be warranted based on previous successful outcomes.

**Follow-Up:**  
- Schedule for examination and necessary diagnostic tests.  
- Monitor for any new symptoms or changes in condition.
