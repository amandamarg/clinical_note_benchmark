**Patient History:**  
The patient was transferred to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine in May 2008 following a hematoma evacuation and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation for left thalamic hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus. The patient was diagnosed with dysphagia and underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Nutritional support was provided through the PEG without complications until September 2009, when the first PEG site infection occurred. The PEG tube was removed, and a new tube was inserted at another site. Enteral feeding continued through the PEG for 4 years, maintaining the patient's body weight at 70 kg.

In June 2013, the patient stopped responding to verbal commands but responded to pain and was unable to roll over in bed or sit up. New signs of infection were observed around the PEG insertion site, including round swelling, erythematous skin changes, and pus-like discharge. Leukocytosis and increased serum C-reactive protein levels were confirmed, leading to the initiation of intravenous antibiotic therapy. The PEG tube was removed, and the patient was kept fasting with peripheral nutritional support. One month post-PEG removal, complications at the PEG site resolved, leukocytosis resolved, and serum CRP levels normalized, although the patient experienced a 3 kg weight loss.

A new PEG tube was inserted 2 cm above the previous site. Upon resuming enteral feeding, leakage of gastric contents was noted from the second PEG site. Enhanced abdominal CT revealed a gastrocutaneous fistula around the second PEG insertion site. Despite medical management, spontaneous fistula closure did not occur after one month. The patient underwent simple suturing of the fistula and was kept fasting. After 2 weeks, the fistula resolved.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and follow up on nutritional support and PEG site management.
