They cover the patient's transfer to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine in May 2008, the initial PEG insertion, the first PEG site infection in September 2009, and subsequent events leading up to the complications in 2013. Both notes detail the patient's condition, including the infections, the removal and reinsertion of PEG tubes, the development of a gastrocutaneous fistula, and the eventual insertion of a gastrojejunostomy tube. The main difference is that the second note includes a \"Plan\" section, which outlines the ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's condition."}}
