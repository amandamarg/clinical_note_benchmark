Both describe the medical history and treatment of a 22-year-old Chinese woman with a diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, triple negative for ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. They detail the progression of her disease, including the initial presentation with a painless swelling in the left breast, the increase in size of the mass during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the subsequent mastectomy and axillary clearance. Both notes mention her decision to pursue Traditional Chinese Medication after adjuvant chemotherapy and her later presentation with a large fungating mass and inability to move her left upper limb. The notes also discuss the grave prognosis and the recommendation for urgent follow-up and consideration of palliative care options."}}
