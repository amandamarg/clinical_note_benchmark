**Chief Complaint:**  
Painless swelling in the left breast.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient first noticed a painless swelling in the left breast three months ago, which has gradually increased in size. There are no other symptoms such as nipple discharge or swelling elsewhere. A core biopsy confirmed infiltrating ductal carcinoma, triple negative for ER, PR, and HER2 receptors. A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for distant metastasis. 

**Treatment History:**  
The patient initially underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, two weeks into the treatment, the left breast mass increased from 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter, and a swelling in the left axilla consistent with an axillary lymph node was noted. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the left axillary lymph node confirmed metastatic carcinoma. Consequently, a left mastectomy and axillary clearance were performed. Histopathology of the left breast mass confirmed high-grade metaplastic breast carcinoma â€“ spindle cell subtype, with triple negative receptor status. All 12 excised axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastases. The patient then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy but defaulted follow-up soon after completion, opting for Traditional Chinese Medication instead.

**Current Presentation:**  
Four months after defaulting follow-up, the patient presented with complaints of pain over the left chest wall and inability to move the left upper limb. Examination revealed a large fungating mass with a necrotic patch on the left chest wall, extending into the axilla. The tumor has infiltrated the anterior chest wall and is visible over the posterior chest wall.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The prognosis is grave. The patient is strongly advised to continue with follow-up and treatment. Further management options and palliative care should be discussed with the patient and family. 

**Recommendations:**  
- Urgent follow-up with oncology for further management.
- Consideration of palliative care options.
- Psychological support for the patient and family.
