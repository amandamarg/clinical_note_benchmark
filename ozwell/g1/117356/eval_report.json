They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 12-year-old female patient who initially presented with a generalized convulsion, loss of consciousness, and left-sided hemiplegia at age 5. Both notes detail the imaging studies performed, including CT scans, MRIs, and angiograms, which revealed a gliotic cavity and later an arteriovenous malformation. They also describe the progression of the patient's condition, including intermittent and then intractable seizures, leading to surgical resection of the arteriovenous malformation. The follow-up plan and the patient's current status are also consistent between the two notes."}}
