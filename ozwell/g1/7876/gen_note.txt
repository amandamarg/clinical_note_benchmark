**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: Not specified
- Gender: Male
- Relevant Medical History: Cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis at age 32

**Chief Complaint:**
- Abdominal pain for the past 2 months

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports experiencing abdominal pain for the past 2 months, which has been gradually worsening. The pain is located on the right side of the abdomen. It is mostly dull but occasionally sharp, particularly when changing posture. The patient has a history of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis at age 32. He moved to Japan for work 3 years ago and recently returned from a trip to Latin America. Since returning to Japan, his weight has increased from 130 kg to 145 kg.

The patient first visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after the onset of pain, where gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected and treated with tiquizium bromide, but most of the pain persisted. A subsequent evaluation by a urologist was negative. The pain is exacerbated by changes in posture, suggesting a somatic origin. Treatment with loxoprofen sodium hydrate was initiated, but the abdominal pain persisted.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**
- Hematologic laboratory analysis: No cause identified
- Urine analysis: No cause identified
- Gastroscopy: No cause identified
- Abdominal computed tomography: No cause identified
- Screening for depression: Negative
- Physical examination: Positive for Carnett's sign
- Vital signs: Within normal limits

**Social History:**
- Recent travel to Latin America
- No history of sexually transmitted infection

**Assessment:**
The etiology of the patient's abdominal pain remains unclear despite extensive evaluation. The positive Carnett's sign suggests a somatic origin of the pain.

**Plan:**
Further tests will be scheduled to better understand the cause of the pain. The patient is advised to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain. 

**Follow-Up:**
The patient will be contacted to schedule further diagnostic tests and to discuss a treatment plan once more information is available. 

**Patient's Agreement:**
The patient is agreeable to further testing and is eager to find relief from the pain.
