Both notes highlight the emotional stress and overwhelm the caregiver feels due to his responsibilities, the significant life event of his father's death, and the exacerbation of stress during the pandemic. They both mention the caregiver's feelings of sadness, distress, and hopelessness, as well as the impact on his emotional well-being. Additionally, both notes suggest seeking therapy or counseling and engaging in stress-reducing activities as part of the plan to help the caregiver cope with his responsibilities."}}
