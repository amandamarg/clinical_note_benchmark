They both describe the same patient's medical history, the discovery of a lung nodule, and the subsequent procedures performed. Both notes detail the use of the Da Vinci Xi robot for the resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass, along with a right lower lobe superior segmentectomy. They mention the use of indocyanine green angiography, the division of the superior segmental branches, and the reconstruction of the airway. Both notes confirm that the lesions were benign and that the patient was discharged without complications. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, but the core information is consistent across both notes."}}
