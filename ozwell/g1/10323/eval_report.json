Both describe the same patient's medical history, the incident of falling down the stairs, the discovery of a pseudoaneurysm, and the subsequent medical management and surgery. They both outline the patient's initial presentation, the findings from the CT scans, the decision against an endovascular approach, the surgical procedure performed, and the patient's recovery and follow-up. The structure and details are consistent across both notes, with minor variations in wording and organization."}}
