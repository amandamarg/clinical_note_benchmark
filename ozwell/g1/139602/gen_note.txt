**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 16 years
- Gender: Male
- Ethnicity: Caucasian

**Medical History:**
- The patient has a history of unilateral cleft lip and palate.
- Underwent repair of cleft lip and palate at ages 6 and 14 months.
- Medical history is otherwise unremarkable.
- Born after a full-term pregnancy and normal delivery.

**Dental History:**
- At age 8, deciduous teeth were extracted under short general anesthetic due to problems.
- Extensive orthodontic treatment resulted in the presence of both right and left maxillary canines in the arch.
- Radiographs show absence of maxillary right central and lateral incisors due to increased mobility and infection.
- Maxilla composed of a lesser and larger segment with a wide maxillary cleft.

**Orthodontic and Surgical Plan:**
- Pre-grafting orthodontics and segmental distraction approach were decided to minimize the gap.
- One year of orthodontic treatment achieved alignment of maxillary teeth and a 3 mm initial space between the 1st molar and 2nd premolar to minimize risk of dental root injury during surgery.
- Right maxillary alveolar bony segment was exposed by a high maxillary sulcus incision under general anesthesia.

**Procedure Plan:**
- A secondary alveolar bone grafting procedure is planned to close the gap in the maxilla.
- Mobilization of the lesser maxillary segment anteriorly will be performed to minimize the gap.

**Patient Understanding and Follow-up:**
- The patient understands the importance of the procedure to prevent further complications and ensure a successful outcome.
- Follow-up requirements post-procedure have been instructed and the patient has agreed to adhere to them.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with scheduling the secondary alveolar bone grafting procedure.
