Both notes detail the initial surgery with tension band wiring and cerclage wiring, the breakage and migration of the cerclage wire, and the subsequent surgical procedure to remove the wire fragment. They both mention the patient's lack of symptoms initially, the loss to follow-up, and the eventual return to the clinic when the wire perforated the skin. The notes also describe the examination and surgical steps taken to locate and remove the wire fragment, as well as the patient's postoperative condition and follow-up instructions. Overall, the notes are very similar in content, covering the same sequence of events and medical assessments."}}
