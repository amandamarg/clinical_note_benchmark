They both describe the case of a 12-month-old girl with an abdominal mass, asymmetry in her limbs and cheeks, and a diagnosis of Wilms tumor. Both notes detail the initial misdiagnosis of congenital hip dislocation, the eventual discovery of the renal mass, and the treatment plan involving preoperative chemotherapy and surgery. The follow-up care and the patient's remission status are also mentioned in both notes. The main difference is in the level of detail and structure, but the core information is consistent across both notes."}}
