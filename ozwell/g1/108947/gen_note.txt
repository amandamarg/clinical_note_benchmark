**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a distal radius fracture in the left hand due to a road traffic accident. The patient was hit by a car while crossing the road. Post-accident, the patient experienced an inability to move fingers and significant pain. No neurovascular deficit distal to the injury was reported, and the patient could move fingers. The patient reported feeling crepitus in the distal part of the radius just proximal to the wrist joint, with painful and limited movements around the wrist. No other associated injuries were noted. The patient's medical history is not significant for any medical illness.

**Objective:**  
Clinical examination and radiographs confirmed a fracture of the lower end radius. Radiographs showed a comminuted fracture of the distal third radius with intra-articular extension.

**Assessment:**  
The initial plan was for open reduction and internal fixation through a volar FCR approach using a 3.5 mm distal end radius locking plate. However, during the procedure, the absence of the FCR tendon was noted due to severe swelling of the distal forearm. The palmaris longus tendon was initially misidentified as the FCR tendon. The median nerve was found just radial to the PL tendon, confirming the anatomical abnormality. The approach was changed to the classic Hen.

**Plan:**  
Monitor the patient's hand progress and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and recovery.
