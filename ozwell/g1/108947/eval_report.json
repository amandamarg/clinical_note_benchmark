Both notes mention the absence of significant medical history, the clinical examination findings, the initial and revised surgical approach, and the successful outcome post-surgery. The main difference is in the level of detail and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and structured into subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
