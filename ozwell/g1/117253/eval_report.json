The first note is a comprehensive case summary, detailing the patient's initial condition, medical interventions, and follow-up over two years.

It includes the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, imaging results, and initial procedures performed.\n\nOverall, both notes cover the same incident but serve different purposes: one as a detailed case study and the other as an initial clinical assessment."}}
