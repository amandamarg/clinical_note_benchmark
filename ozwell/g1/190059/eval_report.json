Both describe the medical history and findings of a 40-year-old Asian woman who was found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung and a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone. They both mention the initial suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, the procedures performed (video-assisted thoracic surgery and curettage), and the postoperative course where the patient remained free of disease 41 months after the operation. The notes also include details about the histological examination, which identified the tumor as a transitional meningioma. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed histological and immunohistochemical findings, while the second note is a clinical summary from a regular checkup."}}
