**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:31:13 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Fever, coughing up blood, weight loss, chest pain on the left side for 4 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports feeling unwell for an extended period, with symptoms including fever, hemoptysis, significant weight loss, and left-sided chest pain persisting for approximately four weeks. The patient was previously admitted to a regional hospital where a chest x-ray revealed a mass in the chest. Initial suspicion was a neoplasm; however, subsequent endoscopy indicated oesophagitis. The patient developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation.

Further investigation through bronchoscopy ruled out a tumor, and imaging identified the mass as a suspicious aneurysm. Additional tests, including echocardiography and angiography, confirmed a giant aneurysm in the heart, necessitating surgical intervention.

**Surgical History:**  
The patient underwent major cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass and median sternotomy. The surgical team carefully managed the aneurysm, which was attached to the pericardium. The procedure involved the removal of the aneurysm and associated thrombus, closure of a pericardial defect with a patch, and a vein graft in the heart.

**Postoperative Course:**  
Post-surgery, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and required inotropic support. The patient was eventually stabilized and successfully weaned off the ventilator.

**Current Status:**  
The patient reports feeling weak but notes gradual improvement in overall condition.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring recovery progress.
- Follow up with the primary care physician.
- Report any new symptoms or concerns promptly.
