They both describe the case of a 28-year-old male patient with a subtrochanteric fracture of the right thigh following a road traffic accident. Both notes detail the patient's obesity, lack of other comorbidities, and normal preoperative evaluations. They describe the surgical procedure, including the initial plan for antegrade interlocking nailing, the change to dynamic condylar screw fixation, and the specifics of the surgery such as anesthesia, positioning, and blood loss. Postoperative care and the development of well-leg compartment syndrome are also mentioned in both notes, along with the treatment and recovery process. Overall, the notes convey the same clinical information with slight variations in wording and structure."}}
