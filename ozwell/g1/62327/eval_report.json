They both describe the case of an 80-year-old female patient who underwent a total hip replacement for primary osteoarthritis of the left hip using a minimally invasive Watson Jones approach. Both notes mention the use of an uncemented press fit acetabular cup and femoral stem, and that no screws were used for acetabular cup fixation. They describe an uneventful immediate postoperative period with discharge six days after surgery and the use of low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis.\n\nBoth notes detail the patient's return with pain and ecchymosis in the left inguinal region, weakness, and numbness over the medial aspect of the left thigh and knee. They describe the physical examination findings, blood investigations showing mild anemia, and imaging results, including normal spine radiographs and MRI, and a CT showing a mass around the left lesser trochanter.\n\nThe diagnosis of femoral nerve palsy due to delayed hematoma development in the iliopsoas region is consistent in both notes. They also mention the attempted aspiration of the hematoma, the refusal of CT-guided aspiration by the radiologist, and the plan for surgical decompression. The surgical intervention details, including the identification and securing of the femoral nerve and artery, removal of the organized hematoma, and management of the bleeding vessel, are also similar."}}
