**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling and pain on the right side.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a swelling on the right side, which has been present for about a month. The patient describes the pain as hard. 

**Physical Examination:**
A submucosal tumor was found in the right nasal vestibule upon examination.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- **Biopsy:** Suspected malignancy.
- **CT Scan:** Revealed a round lesion, approximately 1 cm in length, near the pyriform fossa edge of the right maxillary bone.

**Medical History:**
- Severe pulmonary dysfunction due to recurrent end-stage lung cancer.
- Diabetes.
- Previous lung cancer surgery four years ago.

**Prognosis:**
Expected remainder of life is approximately six months due to the patient's very poor condition.

**Treatment Plan:**
Due to the patient's condition precluding general anesthesia, a minimally invasive surgery was performed under local anesthesia to relieve nasal pain, shorten hospital stay, and improve quality of life. The procedure involved resecting the nasal vestibular tumors using a right alar incision approach combined with a right gingival incision approach. A right alar flap was used to cover the wounds with exposed bone.

**Surgical Findings:**
- **Histopathology:** Indicated poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the submucosal areas of the nasal vestibule, with no cancer cells on the surface or in the epithelial layers. The edges of the resected tumor were clear of cancer cells.

**Post-Operative Course:**
The patient's right nasal pain is expected to disappear soon after the operation. Discharge from the hospital is planned for 4 days post-operation.

**Follow-Up:**
Two months post-operation, a CT scan revealed widespread destruction of the maxillary bones. Consultation with pathologists and radiologists suggested maxillary bone metastasis from lung carcinoma as the cause of submucosal swelling of the nasal vestibule. Evidence indicated cancerous areas in the submucosa, not in the upper layer, with operative findings confirming cancer tissue generation from the surface of the maxillary bone.
