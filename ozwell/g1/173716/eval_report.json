Both notes detail the patient's initial surgery for a peptic perforation, the subsequent complications including a burst abdomen, and the development of a discharging wound. They both mention the skin graft procedure, the serous discharge from the ulcer, and the suspicion of a gastrocutaneous fistula. The physical examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging findings are consistent across both notes. The assessment and plan in both notes suggest further imaging and follow-up appointments. The main difference is that the first note includes more detailed information about the surgical procedures and outcomes, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary."}}
