They both describe the case of a 35-year-old man with painful, firm, immobile nodules on the dorsum of his left hand, with pus drainage and ulceration. Both notes mention the patient's history of a tumor excision operation, the recurrence of nodules on the surgical scar, and the diagnosis of actinomycosis based on clinical and histopathological data. They also outline the treatment plan with intravenous penicillin G and the importance of follow-up appointments. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the patient's and doctor's names in the clinical note."}}
