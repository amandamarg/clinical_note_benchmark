They both describe the medical history, surgical plan, procedure, and outcome for a 50-year-old woman undergoing breast reconstruction following a nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast. Both notes mention her history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the presence of a lumbar peritoneal shunt tube. They detail the decision to use a DIEP flap for reconstruction, the consultation with brain surgeons regarding the shunt tube, and the successful outcome of the surgery. The postoperative status and follow-up plans are also consistent between the two notes."}}
