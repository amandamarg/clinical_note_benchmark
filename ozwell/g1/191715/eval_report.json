Both notes mention the initial breast implantation in 1995, subsequent surgical revisions, the onset of symptoms in 2014, and the diagnostic imaging and surgical interventions in 2016. They also detail the pathology findings of SCC, the absence of metastatic disease initially, and the treatment with radiation. However, the first note provides a more comprehensive timeline, including the progression of the disease, additional metastases, and the patient's eventual transfer to palliative care, while the second note focuses on the initial diagnosis and treatment plan."}}
