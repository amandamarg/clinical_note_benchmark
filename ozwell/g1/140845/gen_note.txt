**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing left-sided flank pain for the past 12 months, which worsens with deep breathing. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing dyspnea for the past month. The patient has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 20 years ago and completed a six-month course of anti-tuberculosis medication. The patient denies any exposure to environmental or occupational toxins.

**Objective:**  
- Laboratory tests, including tumor markers, were normal upon admission.  
- Acid-fast staining of the sputum was normal.  
- Physical examinations were unremarkable.  
- A chest radiograph taken 8 months ago at another hospital showed ambiguous consolidation in the left lower lung without a definite mass lesion.  
- A follow-up chest radiograph taken 8 months later revealed an irregularly shaped large mass occupying the left lower lung field, compressing the left lower lobe and diaphragm.  
- A chest CT scan showed two irregularly shaped soft tissue masses adjacent to the parietal pleura in the left hemithorax, containing dense calcifications without rib invasion.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient presents with two irregularly shaped masses in the left hemithorax, with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The masses have invaded adjacent structures, including the left lower lobe, chest wall, and diaphragm, but not the ribs.

**Plan:**  
Surgical excision of the masses was performed through left thoracotomy via the 7th intercostal space. Intraoperative findings revealed two hard and irregularly shaped masses with a hard osteoid surface, clearly separated. One mass was 8 cm in size at the costophrenic angle, and the other was 4 cm in size adjacent to the inner surface of the shaft of the 6th rib. The patient is advised to follow up in two weeks for further evaluation and management.  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess post-surgical recovery and discuss further treatment options if necessary.
