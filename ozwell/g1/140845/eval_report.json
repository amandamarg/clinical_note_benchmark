Both describe the case of a 37-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis who presented with left-sided flank pain and dyspnea. They detail the discovery of two irregularly shaped masses in the left hemithorax, their growth over time, and the subsequent surgical excision. Both notes mention the normal laboratory tests, the absence of rib invasion, and the histological findings of osteosarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. The treatment plan involving surgical excision and adjuvant chemotherapy is also consistent across both notes. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and structured in a SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format."}}
