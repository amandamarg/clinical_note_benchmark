**Time:** 7:26:34 PM  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  
**Location:** Emergency Department  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Tenderness in the right arm extending to the hand after injecting crushed zolpidem tablets.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with pain in the right arm after injecting crushed zolpidem tablets dissolved in water into the ulnar side of the distal right forearm. The pain started immediately after the injection and radiated down the arm into the hand. The patient denied any local inflammation at the injection site.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Motor strength: 5/5, within normal limits.  
- Digital two-point discrimination and capillary refill of acral digits: Within normal limits.  
- Radial pulse: Strong.  
- Ulnar pulse: Not palpable.  

**Initial Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient was discharged with analgesic medication and advised to return if symptoms worsened.

**Follow-up Visit:**  
The patient returned to the emergency department with ischemic symptoms in the right hand, referred by the general practitioner. The right hand was cold, held in a flexed position, with no ulnar artery pulse and only a faint radial artery pulse palpable. Allen's test was pathological, and there was blue discoloration on the right hand. Tenderness was noted over the thenar eminence, and hypoesthesia was present over digits 1 through 5.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Angiography: No flow in the distal ulnar artery and absent deep and superficial palmar arch perfusion.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for urokinase lysis via an indwelling intraarterial catheter. The urokinase lysis was initiated at a dose of 240,000 IU/h for 2 hours, followed by half the dose for 2 hours. The patient was closely monitored for possible compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand, with decompressive surgical intervention planned if necessary.

**Outcome:**  
The patient passed away three hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy. Despite the return of normal skin color to the right hand, the patient's condition worsened and he could not be saved.

**Family Communication:**  
The patient's family was informed of the patient's passing. They expressed gratitude for the care provided. Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time.
