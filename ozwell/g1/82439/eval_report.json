Both notes mention the findings of adrenal gland nodules, multiple vertebral fractures, and the diagnosis of ACTH-independent hypercortisolism. They also discuss the therapeutic challenge posed by the presence of adenomas in both adrenal glands and the plan to perform adrenal venous sampling to determine the origin of cortisol production. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the procedure and its outcome, while the second note focuses on the patient's subjective experience, medical history, and the plan for further investigation."}}
