**Time:** 8:06:56 PM  

**Patient History:**

The patient underwent breast implantation for augmentation in 1995, followed by surgical revisions in 2002 and 2006. In 2014, the patient noticed hardening and swelling of the right breast but did not seek immediate medical attention due to the death of her husband. The patient continued to experience swelling and increased pain in the right breast.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**

In January 2016, an MRI was performed, revealing a large fluid collection surrounding the intact right silicone implant.

**Surgical Interventions:**

The case was managed by surgical drainage of the fluid collection and capsulectomy. In February 2016, the patient underwent bilateral prosthesis explantation and bilateral capsulectomy.

**Pathology Findings:**

Pathology demonstrated a 4-cm moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that extended into the muscle. In situ tumor was noted to extend to the peripheral margin. There was no perineural or lymphovascular invasion.

**Plan:**

The patient will continue to be monitored for any further developments or complications. Further treatment options and follow-up care will be discussed as necessary.
