They both describe the same clinical case of an 8-year-old male patient with a history of a motor vehicle accident leading to a fracture on the right side of the mandible. Both notes detail the swelling and pus discharge on the right side of the jaw, the presence of interdental wiring, and the dental abnormalities observed. They also describe the radiographic findings, including the presence of a bone plate and screws, the fracture line, and the malunion of the subcondylar fracture. The diagnosis of malunited fractures of the body and the condyle of the mandible on opposite sides is consistent in both notes. The treatment plan, including the removal of interdental wiring, crevicular incision, retrieval of screws and bone plate, and prophylactic extraction of certain teeth, is also the same. Both notes mention the uneventful post-operative period and the plan for follow-up."}}
