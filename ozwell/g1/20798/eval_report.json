Both notes mention her antihypertensive treatment with valsartan and bisoprolol, her past anesthetic history, and the issues with blood pressure control leading to the postponement of the surgery. They also detail the diagnostic studies performed, including abdominal ultrasound, echocardiography, and ECG, and note that her blood pressure was eventually controlled, allowing her to be deemed fit for surgery. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the intraoperative events and postoperative care, while the second note is a clinical summary leading up to the decision to proceed with surgery."}}
