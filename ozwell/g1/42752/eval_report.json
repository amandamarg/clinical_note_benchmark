Both describe the medical history and treatment of an 82-year-old male patient with a large right IIA aneurysm and a history of complicated aortoiliac endovascular interventions. They detail the patient's comorbidities, previous surgeries, and the development of bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. Both notes mention the unsuccessful attempt at endovascular embolisation and the decision to use a direct puncture method under CT guidance to treat the aneurysm. The procedure details, including the use of a 17-gauge needle and embolisation with coils and liquid agents, are also consistent across both notes. The main difference is the format and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and structured into subjective, objective, plan, procedure, and assessment sections."}}
