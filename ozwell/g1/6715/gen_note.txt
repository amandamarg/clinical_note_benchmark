**Chief Complaint:**  
Persistent wound discharge in the upper abdomen for one month.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a wound in the upper abdomen that has been discharging for the past month. The issue began approximately six months ago when the patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical facility due to abdominal pain lasting three days. During the procedure, a small perforation in the stomach was identified and repaired with an omental patch. Post-operatively, the patient developed a burst abdomen on the fourth day, which was managed conservatively, allowing the bowel to become contained. The patient was transitioned to oral nutrition and was stable at home. However, the wound did not heal, and in the fourth month, a split thickness skin graft was applied. The procedure and post-operative period were uneventful until the fifth month when the patient noticed a serous discharge from a small ulcer on the upper part of the grafted surface. The discharge was small in amount, and the patient managed it by applying gauze pieces over the wound, changing them once or two to three times daily.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Abdomen: A 12 cm x 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft is present over the middle of the abdomen. A small depressed ulcer approximately 1 cm x 1 cm is noted in the upper part of the graft, covered with pale granulation tissue and showing serous ooze. Additional spots with exuberant pale granulation are observed. A scar is present at the previous drain site. Palpation reveals a deficient abdominal wall beneath the skin graft.

**Laboratory Results:**  
- Hemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl  
- Total WBC count: 11.6 x 10^3/mm^3  
- Total serum protein: 7.9 gm/dl  
- Serum albumin: 3.5 gm/dl  

**Imaging:**  
- Ultrasound: Left subphrenic collection measuring 8 cm x 7 cm.

**Assessment:**  
The clinical findings and imaging suggest a suspicion of missed pathology from the previous exploratory laparotomy, potentially contributing to the current wound issues.

**Plan:**  
- Referral to a specialist for further evaluation of the suspected missed pathology.
- Continue current wound care with regular gauze changes as the patient has been doing.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be contacted for follow-up after specialist evaluation.
