Both notes detail the initial emergency exploratory laparotomy, the development of a burst abdomen, the application of a skin graft, and the subsequent serous discharge from the grafted area. They also mention the suspicion of a gastrocutaneous fistula, confirmed by a CT fistulogram, and the repeat surgery performed to address the issue. The clinical note provides a structured timeline and assessment, while the narrative offers a more detailed account of the patient's medical journey. Overall, the notes are highly similar, with the clinical note being a concise summary of the detailed narrative."}}
