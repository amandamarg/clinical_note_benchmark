Both describe the same medical procedure involving a 64-year-old patient with a history of radiation treatment for squamous carcinoma in the left lower jaw. They detail the composite resection and reconstruction using a fibula free flap, the issue with inadequate blood flow in the superior thyroid artery, and the decision to use retrograde vascularization via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. Both notes outline the successful completion of the procedure and the plan to monitor the patient for proper healing. The main difference is in the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and medical details are consistent."}}
