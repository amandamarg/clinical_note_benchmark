Both describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with generalized right knee pain and a history of chronic alcohol consumption. They detail her medical history, including a previous bipolar hip replacement for avascular necrosis of the left hip, and the absence of steroid intake or trauma. Both notes include findings from physical examinations, imaging, and diagnostic tests, highlighting osteonecrosis in the right knee, right hip, and left knee. The assessment and plan for treatment, including weight-bearing instructions and follow-up, are also consistent between the two notes."}}
