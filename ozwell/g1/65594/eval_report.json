They both describe the case of a 27-year-old Japanese woman who was referred to the Obstetric Outpatient Clinic for examination of a fetal cardiac tumor during her first pregnancy. Both notes detail the findings from ultrasonographic examinations, the management and follow-up of the case, the delivery information, and the post-delivery examination of the infant. The notes also mention the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis in the infant and the management plan. The main difference is in the level of detail and the format, but the core information is consistent across both notes."}}
