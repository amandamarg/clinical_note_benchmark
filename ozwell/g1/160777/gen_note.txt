**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with discomfort and sharp pain in the upper right molar area, specifically when biting on the right side of the mouth.

**Objective:**  
Clinical and radiographic examination revealed localized severe chronic periodontitis associated with the maxillary right second premolar and the maxillary right first molar. The maxillary right second molar was found to be in a healthy condition without an opposing tooth.

**Assessment:**  
Due to the patient's financial difficulty, autotransplantation was determined to be the best option instead of implant installation. A periodontist was consulted, and it was planned to transplant the maxillary right second molar to the maxillary right first molar space, followed by periodontal treatment.

**Plan:**  
- Scaling and root planning were performed one month prior to autotransplantation.  
- Due to trismus, root canal therapy was performed post-surgery.  
- Under local anesthesia, the maxillary right first molar was extracted, and the recipient site was prepared with a round bur and a duplicated tooth model.  
- The maxillary right second molar was extracted and immediately placed into the recipient site, stabilized with 4-0 silk sutures and a semi-rigid resin wire splint.  
- The extra-oral time from extraction to transplantation was 11 minutes.  
- Prescribed medications: Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day and Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day for one week, and a 0.1% chlorhexidine rinse for 7 days.  
- Root canal therapy began 2 weeks post-surgery. After maintaining a calcium hydroxide dressing for 2 weeks, root canal therapy was completed 4 weeks post-surgery.  
- At the 7-month follow-up, there were no clinical symptoms or radiographic signs of root resorption.  
- Regenerative periodontal surgery was performed on the maxillary right second premolar, which had a deep periodontal pocket.  
- New bone formation around the bifurcation area of the transplanted tooth was confirmed during surgery.  
- The autotransplanted tooth will be restored with a full crown.  
- At the 18-month follow-up, the patient showed no issues. The patient was advised to maintain good oral hygiene and return for regular checkups.  

**Follow-up:**  
Continue regular dental checkups and maintain oral hygiene.
