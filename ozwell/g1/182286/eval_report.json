Both notes detail the patient's injury during a bench press, the initial treatment with ice and a sling, the negative X-ray results, and the subsequent presentation at the orthopedic clinic with swelling and bruising. They both mention the MRI findings of a pectoralis major tendon avulsion and the scheduled surgery. Additionally, both notes describe the patient's return with severe pain leading to a diagnosis of compartment syndrome and the emergency fasciotomy performed. The medications prescribed and the plan for surgery and monitoring are also consistent across both notes."}}
