**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Smith  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Brown  

**Reason for Referral:**  
Mrs. Smith was referred to our department for the evaluation of wound dehiscence on her left knee with hardware exposure.

**Medical History:**  
- Total left hip arthroplasty at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain.
- Eight years post-arthroplasty, presented with progressive hip pain, particularly during ambulation.
- X-ray revealed extensive femoral bone loss and displacement of the femoral component; MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor.
- Underwent revision total hip arthroplasty with insertion of a reconstruction ring and cemented dual mobility cups.

**Post-Surgical Complications:**  
- Three weeks post-revision surgery, developed early symptoms of infection: high fever, suppuration, no wound healing, and laboratory abnormalities.
- Conservative management with IV antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful.
- Planned two-stage replacement of the endoprosthesis femur.

**Surgical Interventions:**  
- **First Stage:** Removal of previous prosthesis with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity; placement of a cement spacer with antibiotics.
- **Second Stage:** Two months later, removal of spacer and placement of a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis.

**Current Assessment:**  
- Referred to our unit four weeks post-second stage surgery for assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure.
- Taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap.

**Coverage Decision:**  
- Initial plan to cover defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap was not feasible due to highly scarred surrounding area and atrophic gastrocnemius muscle.
- Opted for a free flap as no local flaps were large enough to cover the defect.

**Examination of Receptor Vessels:**  
- Lack of suitable receptor vessels noted.
- Descending genicular artery dissected but found to have small caliber and calcified plaques, thus discarded.

**Plan:**  
Further evaluation and planning for appropriate wound coverage and management of hardware exposure.
