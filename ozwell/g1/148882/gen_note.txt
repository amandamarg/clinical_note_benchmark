**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Right inguinal region mass with pain for the past 3 months.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a right inguinal region mass and associated pain for the past 3 months. The patient has a history of hernia surgery a year ago due to a fixed mass in the same area. No special history of disease was reported.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital signs: Stable.  
- Examination revealed a hard, fixed mass in the right inguinal region, measuring 1 cm Ã— 1 cm, with oppressive pain.  

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Biopsy of the spermatic cord indicated metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma.  
- Scrotal sonography confirmed thickening of the right spermatic cord and infiltration around soft tissues.  
- Abdominal CT showed infiltration of the proximal sigmoid colon and rectum, with diffuse peritoneal seeding metastasis.  
- Colonoscopy revealed a tumor with redness in the rectum; core needle biopsy confirmed mucinous adenocarcinoma identical to the spermatic cord tissue.  
- PET scan confirmed infiltration of the sigmoid colon, rectum, and cecum.  

**Treatment and Progress:**  
- The patient received four rounds of FOLFOX anticancer chemotherapy (oxaliplatin with fluorouracil and folinic acid).  
- Follow-up abdominal CT after 10 weeks showed a reduction in the right spermatic cord mass, but no change in tumor sizes in the sigmoid colon and rectum.  
- Exploratory laparotomy was conducted to assess the possibility of salvage surgery for the primary lesion in the large intestine. Only an orchiectomy on the right was performed, as the primary lesion could not be removed.  

**Plan:**  
- The patient is advised to follow up regularly to monitor the condition and ensure the cancer does not spread further.
