**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Occasional pain, numbness, and paralysis of the right hand.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing occasional pain, numbness, and paralysis of the right hand. Symptoms began with weakness in the left hand approximately 2 years ago. The patient denies any history of trauma or family history of amyloid neuropathy. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Ovarian tumor 25 years ago, resolved after surgical resection.  
- Thyroid tumor 5 years ago, resolved after surgical resection.

**Current Symptoms:**  
- Numbness on the ulnar side of the left hand and fingers.  
- Muscle weakness with abduction and adduction of the ring finger and the little finger.

**Physical Examination:**  
- A mass measuring 5 × 3 cm was found on the ulnar side of the left proximal forearm. The lesion was firm, nonpulsatile, and tender on palpation.  
- 2-point discrimination test: 15 mm at the lateral side of the ring finger and 10 mm at the little finger.  
- Electrophysiological study: Significant decrease in the motor nerve conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve from distal to the mass to proximal to the mass.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- MRI: Ulnar nerve swollen longitudinally, spindle shape, measuring 3.0 × 2.7 cm in the axial plane and 7.2 cm longitudinally. The lesion showed relatively homogeneous isosignal intensity on T1-weighted images and relative heterogeneous enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent with findings of flow void.

**Differential Diagnosis:**  
- Vascular malformation surrounding and compressing the ulnar nerve.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- Surgical exploration with a longitudinal incision was performed.  
- Operative findings: No vascular malformation was present. Ulnar nerve fascicles were swollen and degenerated, with the affected lesion changing into a yellow tissue. The yellow tissue was removed.

**Plan:**  
The patient should expect improvement in symptoms following the removal of the yellow tissue. However, some numbness and weakness in the hand may persist. The patient's progress will be monitored over the next few weeks.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up appointments to monitor recovery and address any ongoing symptoms or concerns. 

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the findings and the expected outcomes post-surgery. They were encouraged to ask questions and report any new or worsening symptoms.
