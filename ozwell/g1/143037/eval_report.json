Both describe a 57-year-old male patient with stage IV metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma experiencing left-sided facial pain. They detail the patient's history of present illness, including the nature of the pain, previous imaging results, and the initial diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. Both notes mention the failure of methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine to relieve the pain, and the subsequent discovery of a metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone affecting the inferior alveolar nerve. The treatment plan, including the referral to radiation oncology and the use of a sphenopalatine ganglion block and radiofrequency ablation, is also consistent across both notes. The outcome and family communication are mentioned in the second note, providing additional context about the patient's passing and the family's response."}}
