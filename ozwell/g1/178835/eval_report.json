They both describe the case of a 77-year-old female patient with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, which had been present for three years and had grown over time. Both notes mention the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), the physical examination findings, imaging results, and the surgical intervention to excise the mass. They also both conclude with the postoperative outcome and the pathology results confirming a glomus tumor. The main difference is in the level of detail and the format, with the clinical note being more structured and detailed."}}
