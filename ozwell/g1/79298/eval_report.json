Both describe the medical history and recent events of a 79-year-old male patient who underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with a renal stent placement for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). They both mention the development of a pseudoaneurysm in the left brachial artery, which was repaired, and the subsequent diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) type II. Both notes detail the patient's symptoms, including pain in the left hand, weakness in the left arm, and other complications. They also mention the treatment attempts and the patient's eventual passing due to a respiratory infection unrelated to the CRPS. The main difference is in the format and specific details included, such as the time and date of the clinical note and the physician's signature in the second note."}}
