Both describe the case of a 29-year-old gentleman who experienced swelling and progressive pain in his left big toe following an injury. They detail the initial treatment at another institution, the recurrence of symptoms, and the subsequent examination and diagnosis at the Specialist Outpatient Clinic. Both notes mention the unsuccessful manual reduction attempt, the decision for surgical intervention, and the follow-up plan. The main difference is in the level of detail and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and formatted for medical documentation."}}
