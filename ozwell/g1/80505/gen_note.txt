**Chief Complaint:**  
Swelling and progressive pain in the left big toe following a fall.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with swelling and progressive pain in the left big toe after sustaining an axial loading and hyperdorsiflexion injury from falling foot first into a drain. Initially, the patient sought medical attention at another institution's emergency department, where symptomatic treatment was provided, and radiographs of the left great toe were performed. The radiographs did not reveal any acute fracture, and the patient was advised to rest and follow up at the Orthopaedic Surgery Specialist Outpatient Clinic 2 weeks later. The patient reported initial improvement and returned to running and playing field hockey. However, three weeks post-injury, the patient experienced a recurrence of pain and swelling in the left great toe, limiting function.

**Physical Examination:**  
Examination revealed the affected big toe to be shortened and dorsally dislocated compared to the contralateral side. There was tenderness and swelling at the interphalangeal (IP) joint. During ambulation, the plantar side of the great toe did not contact the floor. There was a lack of active movement of the affected IP joint, and passive maneuvering was also not possible. Normal motion was maintained over the left metatarsophalangeal joint.

**Investigations:**  
Plain radiography showed obliquity of the IP joint line with an interposed sesamoid bone. These findings, along with the clinical presentation, suggest dislocation of the IP joint of the left big toe.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
An attempted manual reduction was unsuccessful. Surgical reduction is advised due to persistent swelling and functional limitations. The patient was initially hesitant about surgical intervention as prescribed analgesics were effective in managing pain, and the patient could walk and jog without severe symptoms. However, the patient has now returned, expressing willingness to proceed with surgical intervention due to ongoing swelling. Surgery will be scheduled.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for surgical reduction of the dislocated IP joint. Further follow-up will be arranged post-surgery to monitor recovery and rehabilitation progress.
