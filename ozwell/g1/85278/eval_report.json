They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 69-year-old woman with a calcified mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. Both notes mention the initial identification of the mass in 2008, the patient's past medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis and systemic hypertension, and the absence of infectious endocarditis, chest trauma, or thrombus formation. They also discuss the differential diagnoses considered, the patient's refusal of initial surgical treatment, and the eventual surgical removal of the mass in 2011. The notes detail the surgical procedure, histopathological examination, and the patient's recovery. Overall, the content and sequence of events in both notes are consistent with each other."}}
