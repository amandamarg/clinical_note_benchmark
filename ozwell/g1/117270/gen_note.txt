**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right arm injury.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a crush and degloving injury to the right elbow sustained while operating a waste agitator at an industrial waste management site. Initial examination revealed massive skin and soft tissue defects on the anterior aspect of the elbow, with exposure and contamination of the median nerve and brachial artery. The proximal part of the entire extensor muscle group was lost, along with a segmental loss of the radial nerve, resulting in a 6-cm gap. The patient is unable to extend the right wrist or fingers. Severe muscle weakness was noted, with a manual muscle testing score of 0 or 1 in areas innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. Distal perfusion in the right arm was present but weaker compared to the contralateral arm.

**Treatment and Surgical History:**  
The wound was initially irrigated and debrided. A bacterial infection was detected post-operatively, threatening further obstruction of the brachial artery. The patient underwent additional debridement, a saphenous vein bypass graft to reperfuse the occluded artery, and placement of a muscle flap to close the open wound using the distal part of the extensor muscles, which were not salvageable due to the proximal muscle injury and radial nerve defect. The infection subsequently resolved.

**Current Status:**  
The ulnar collateral artery was found to perfuse distally due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft. Muscle strengths have improved to 2 or 3 on the manual muscle test, though there are no signs of recovery in the extensor muscles. Protective sensation is confirmed in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves.

**Plan:**  
Reconstruction of finger extension with stabilization of the wrist is planned. The tendons of extensor carpi radialis and the tendon of abductor pollicis longus will be secured to the radius under 30° of dorsiflexion at the wrist and 10° of radial abduction of the thumb. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor progress.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up regularly to monitor recovery and the effectiveness of the planned reconstruction.
