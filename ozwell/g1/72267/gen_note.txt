**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented for a follow-up visit. He has a history of bilateral total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed in 1995 at a different institution using Biomet Bi-Metric stem and Ringloc cup through a posterior approach due to debilitating bilateral hip pain and a shorter right leg. The surgery was performed without complications. The patient reported feeling great for two years post-surgery but then developed a draining sinus tract of the left thigh and bilateral periprosthetic infections, which were not confirmed with aspiration. The patient opted against revision surgery and was placed on chronic antibiotics. He reported no risk factors for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).

**Objective:**  
The patient was first seen in the clinic in 2004, reporting no hip pain but decreased hip range of motion and heterotopic ossification around both hips on X-ray. He had no systemic symptoms but continued to experience drainage from the sinus of the left thigh. He was taking amoxicillin at that time. By the 2005 visit, the patient had started to wean off amoxicillin as there had been no drainage from the sinus tract for several months.

**Assessment:**  
The patient understood the risks associated with discontinuing antibiotics, which had been beneficial in suppressing the hip infection. He expressed understanding and planned to monitor symptoms while continuing to wean off antibiotics.

**Plan:**  
The patient will continue to monitor his symptoms and follow up if any complications arise. He is advised to return to the clinic if he experiences any symptoms or concerns. 

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return for follow-up as needed.
