Both describe a 25-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent pain and swelling on the right cheek for three months. They both mention the patient's previous bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, during which a dislodged orthodontic appliance was noted and left in-situ. The notes detail the examination findings, including a sinus with pus discharge and tenderness in the upper right vestibular region. Both notes assess that the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance and suggest further tests to confirm the need for removal to prevent complications. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the surgical exploration and removal of the appliance, while the second note outlines the plan for further tests and follow-up."}}
