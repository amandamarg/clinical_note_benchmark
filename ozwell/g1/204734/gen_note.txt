**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  
**Procedure:** Elective Left Total Knee Arthroplasty  

**History:**  
The patient has a history of lupus and presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. The patient had a previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system. The tibial WasherLoc was removed about 10 years ago. The patient reports no current issues related to the previous ACL reconstruction.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The patient was positioned supine and underwent a standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. A measured resection technique was performed with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was initially placed but noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. It was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was placed back on the femur and was noted to be in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The screw was located and identified in the lateral femoral condyle; a curette was used to clear the head of the screw, and it was removed.

The proximal tibia was prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; the knee was noted to be tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. During trialing of the prostheses, the lateral femoral condyle was fractured. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted, but during trialing, the medial femoral condyle was also noted to have a fracture. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were then reamed.

**Outcome:**  
Despite best efforts, the patient did not survive the surgery. The family was informed of the outcome and expressed gratitude for the efforts made.

**Patient's Reported Experience:**  
The patient reported feeling uncomfortable but not in pain during the initial incision and resection. Post-procedure, the patient felt good, with only slight soreness. The patient did not recall any specific pain or discomfort during the noted complications or the intraoperative consultation.
