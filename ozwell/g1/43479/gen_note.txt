**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:38:02 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Living Situation:** Lives with wife and son  
- **Recent Travels:** None  
- **Recent Accidents:** None reported initially; later revealed a motorcycle accident 23 years ago with a scalp laceration as the sole injury  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Loss of strength in the upper right arm and hand  
- Paresthesias along the arm  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing loss of strength in the upper right arm and hand, along with paresthesias along the arm for approximately three months. Additionally, the patient has had neck pain that has been occurring on and off for about two years.

**Physical Examination:**  
- General examination: Unremarkable  
- Neurological examination: Upper right limb paresis; rest of the exam was normal  

**Imaging and Findings:**  
- **CT Scan:** Revealed a mass at the level of the odontoid process corresponding to an old fracture of the odontoid process, healed as pseudarthrosis, and significant cervical canal stenosis.  
- **MRI:** Showed signs of myelopathy behind the mass of bone detected in the CT scan, confirming the fracture as an old one and the clinical signs due to spinal cord injury.

**Clinical Impression:**  
The clinical suspicion of spinal cord compression at the upper cervical spinal cord was confirmed by imaging. The findings suggest an old fracture of the odontoid process with pseudarthrosis and cervical canal stenosis, leading to myelopathy.

**Plan:**  
- The patient has been placed in a rigid cervical collar to prevent further damage to the spinal cord.  
- Due to the high risk of myelopathy, the patient is advised to be admitted for immediate surgery.  

**Discussion:**  
The patient was informed about the need for surgery and expressed no questions or concerns regarding the procedure. Follow-up requirements and procedure details will be communicated to the patient.
