They both describe the case of a 42-year-old woman who experienced a temporary visual loss in her left eye. Both notes detail the clinical examination findings, the Doppler ultrasound examination results, and the computed tomographic examination findings. They both conclude that the patient has left ICA agenesis rather than an occlusion and mention an additional aortic arch anomaly. The plan for regular check-ups and a healthy lifestyle is also consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the format and presentation, with one being a narrative and the other a structured clinical note."}}
