Both notes cover the patient's history of muscular dystrophy, symptoms, and recent clinical deterioration. They mention the patient's initial symptoms at age 16, diagnosis at age 25, and recent issues with fine motor tasks and dysphagia. Both notes describe the physical examination findings, including muscle atrophy and weakness, and the MRI findings of Chiari malformation type I with syringohydromyelia.
