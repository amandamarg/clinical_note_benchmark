They both describe the case of a 40-year-old man with severe ischemic pain in the right lower limb, detailing the history of the pain, past medical history, social history, diagnostic studies, and the plan for treatment. Both notes mention the patient's inability to tolerate sitting or lying down due to pain, the presence of gangrenous ulcers, and the findings from the computed tomography-angiogram. They also describe the conservative approach with oral medications, the challenges with positioning for epidural analgesia, and the eventual placement of the epidural catheter while standing. The follow-up plan is also similar, focusing on assessing the effectiveness of the epidural analgesia and determining the next steps in management."}}
