**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe pain in the right leg.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a gradual onset of right leg pain that began approximately 10 months ago, with significant worsening over the past month. The pain intensifies when sitting or lying down and decreases when standing. The patient has tried various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with minimal relief. The pain is severe enough to prevent sitting or lying down, even during sleep.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Carcinoma rectum, status post abdominoperineal resection 8 years ago.
- Former smoker.

**Social History:**  
- Previously worked as an auto rickshaw driver until the onset of current pain.

**Review of Systems:**  
- Presence of gangrenous ulcers over the right thigh and leg.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Computed tomography-angiogram revealed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery, measuring approximately 9.5 cm, extending to the right superficial femoral artery, with near-total occlusion of the lumen and poorly developed collaterals.

**Plan:**  
The patient was initially scheduled for a conventional peripheral angiogram but was unable to lie down due to severe pain. A conservative approach with oral pregabalin, diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol was attempted for 2 days without satisfactory pain relief. Epidural analgesia was planned, but positioning was challenging as the patient could not tolerate sitting or lateral decubitus positions. The patient was somewhat comfortable only in the standing position. Given the special circumstances, an epidural catheter was placed while the patient was standing.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was advised to reach out with any questions or concerns in the future. Further follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the epidural analgesia and to determine the next steps in management.
