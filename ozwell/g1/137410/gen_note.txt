**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X, Head and Neck Specialist  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Ulcerative lesion on the right temporal area of the scalp.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with an ulcerative lesion on the right temporal area of the scalp, which has been present for the last 3 years and has gradually increased in size. The patient reports mild pain associated with the lesion. There is no history of other skin lesions or swelling in the neck. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol consumption, or significant sun exposure.

**Physical Examination:**  
- 3 × 3 cm ulcerative lesion in the right temporal area of the scalp.  
- No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy or postauricular lymphadenopathy.  
- No other suspicious skin lesions of the face or neck.  
- The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

**Investigations:**  
- Head and neck CT: No evidence of pathologic lymph nodes or masses.  
- CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis: Negative for metastatic disease.

**Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a complete local excision and split-thickness skin graft. Histopathology revealed skin tissue infiltrated by neoplastic growth composed of tubules, cords, and nests of malignant cells with extensive perineural invasion. No lymphovascular invasion was noted. Resection margins were clear. Pathology confirmed an apocrine cutaneous carcinoma.

**Follow-up:**  
1.5 years later, the patient presented with right neck lymphadenopathy for the last few weeks. Physical examination revealed a 2 × 2 cm mass in the right posterior neck, consistent with a lymph node. A CT scan of the head and neck showed a 1.8 × 1.5 cm right neck lymph node at level Va with central necrosis. FNA biopsy reported malignant cells consistent with metastatic cutaneous malignancy.

**Treatment:**  
The patient underwent a right modified radical neck dissection. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic cutaneous apocrine carcinoma. The case was discussed in the tumor board, and the plan was to administer adjuvant radiation therapy. No chemotherapy was given.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Apocrine cutaneous carcinoma with metastasis to the neck lymph node.  
- Adjuvant radiation therapy planned.  
- Continue monitoring and follow-up as per oncology recommendations.
