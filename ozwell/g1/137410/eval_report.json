They both describe the case of a 56-year-old male patient with an ulcerative lesion on the right temporal area of the scalp, which was diagnosed as apocrine cutaneous carcinoma. Both notes detail the patient's history, physical examination findings, investigations, procedures, and follow-up. They mention the initial treatment with complete local excision and split-thickness skin graft, the histopathology findings, and the subsequent development of right neck lymphadenopathy. The notes also describe the treatment plan, including the right modified radical neck dissection and the decision to administer adjuvant radiation therapy. The main difference is the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and clinical information are consistent across both notes."}}
