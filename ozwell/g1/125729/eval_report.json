Both describe a 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of severe left calf pain that worsens with standing, walking, and menstruation, and is relieved by leg elevation or massage. Both notes mention that various treatments, including medications, intramuscular electrical stimulation, lidocaine injections, acupuncture, and Korean herbal medications, were ineffective. The physical examination findings, diagnostic tests, and surgical intervention details are consistent across both notes. The outcome and plan are also the same, with the patient experiencing significant pain relief post-surgery and being advised to continue normal activities."}}
