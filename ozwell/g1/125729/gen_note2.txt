**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Severe pain in the left calf for the past 10 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a 10-year history of constant severe pain in the left calf, which exacerbates with standing or walking for more than 30 minutes, particularly during menstruation. The pain is alleviated by elevating the leg in a sitting position or massaging the calf muscles. The patient has tried various medications without significant relief. Intramuscular electrical stimulation for 4 months and repeated muscle injections with lidocaine were also ineffective. Alternative treatments such as acupuncture and Korean herbal medications were attempted multiple times without success.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Location of Pain: Left calf, especially on the medial side.
- Tenderness: Severe tenderness on the medial side of the left calf muscles.
- Calf Swelling: Equivocal.
- Deep Tendon Reflexes: Normal in both lower extremities.
- Muscle Strength: Normal in both lower extremities.
- Sensation: Intact in both lower extremities.
- Straight Leg Raising Test: Normal.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Conventional Radiography: Showed several mottled calcifications within the muscles; no erosions of tibia or fibula.
- Femoral Angiography: Suggested a hemangioma in the left calf.
- MRI: Revealed an enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent an excisional biopsy. Operative findings revealed a mass consisting of several irregular fragments of muscular soft tissue, measuring 6×6×4 cm. The final pathologic diagnosis was intramuscular hemangioma with fatty overgrowth isolated to the soleus muscle, consistent with MRI findings.

**Outcome:**  
Within 1 month post-surgery, the patient reported 90% pain relief and discontinued all pain medications. The patient experiences no pain even with prolonged walking.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to continue normal activities and return for evaluation if there are any changes or worsening of symptoms.
