**Physician:** [Doctor Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe pain in the left calf for the past 10 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a constant severe pain in the left calf, which worsens with standing or walking for more than 30 minutes, particularly during menstruation. The pain is relieved by elevating the leg in a sitting position or massaging the calf muscles. The patient has tried various medications without significant relief and has undergone intramuscular electrical stimulation and muscle injections with lidocaine, which were ineffective. Alternative treatments such as acupuncture and Korean herbal medications were also attempted without much success.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Location of pain: Left calf, especially on the medial side.
- Tenderness: Severe tenderness on the medial side of the left calf muscles.
- Calf swelling: Equivocal.
- Deep tendon reflexes and muscle strength: Normal in both lower extremities.
- Sensation: Intact in both lower extremities.
- Straight leg raising test: Normal.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Conventional radiography of the left leg: Showed several mottled calcifications within the muscles, no erosions of tibia or fibula.
- Femoral angiography: Suggested a hemangioma in the left calf.
- MRI of the left lower extremity: Showed an enhancing soft-tissue mass in the medial aspect of the soleus muscle.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and underwent an excisional biopsy. Operative findings revealed a mass consisting of several irregular fragments of muscular soft tissue, measuring 6×6×4 cm. The final pathologic diagnosis was intramuscular hemangioma with fatty overgrowth isolated to the soleus muscle, consistent with MRI findings.

**Outcome:**  
Within 1 month post-surgery, the patient reported 90% pain relief and discontinued all pain medications. The patient experiences no pain even with prolonged walking.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to continue normal activities and return for evaluation if there are any changes or worsening of symptoms.

**Follow-up:**  
As needed based on symptom changes.
