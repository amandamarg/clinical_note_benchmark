Both describe the same patient's medical history, symptoms, diagnostic findings, and the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedure performed. They include details about the patient's past medical history, medications, vital signs, and diagnostic findings such as the echocardiography results and coronary angiography. The notes also mention the patient's improvement post-procedure and the follow-up plan. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed procedural information and post-procedural outcomes, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary."}}
