**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Brown  

**Subjective:**  
The patient, a [age not specified] year-old, presents with low back pain following two falls. The pain has been ongoing for the last 2 years, initially starting as acute pain when sitting on the floor for extended periods and has now progressed to chronic low back pain. The patient reports that the pain worsens with certain activities, leading to avoidance of sports, although daily activities are still manageable but increasingly difficult. The patient has a history of multiple GP visits over the past 24 months for symptoms including low back pain, sciatica, and later, lower limb numbness and weakness. The patient's father, who has downplayed the symptoms, usually provided the history during these visits. The patient first sought medical attention for low back pain at age 12, with a diagnosis of nonspecific low back pain, and was prescribed paracetamol and a topical ointment.

**Objective:**  
- No physical examination findings documented in the conversation.

**Assessment:**
