**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents with a 4-year history of neck and thoracic spinal pain, exacerbated by studying. The pain occurs approximately once a week and lasts for a couple of days. The patient also reports headaches described as a band of pain across the forehead, with additional ache at the base of the skull and in the temples. Past medical history is unremarkable except for shingles in 2004.

**Objective:**  
Routine physical examination was unremarkable. 

**Assessment:**  
Initial working diagnosis is mid-back pain of mechanical origin with associated muscle hypertonicity. However, the patient reported inability to lie prone on the treatment table or perform basic core stability exercises due to severe abdominal pain, throat tightness, and headache. These symptoms have been present since the patient was eight years old, originating from a ballet class incident involving lying prone on a wooden floor and attempting to touch toes to the head while holding onto the ankle. Palpation around the xiphoid reproduces abdominal pain and throat tightness immediately, with headache onset a few minutes later, persisting for several hours. 

**Plan:**  
- Proposed a course of chiropractic treatments including SMT to spinal levels with restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to upper back musculature, and core stability exercises.
- Further tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis of xiphoid.
- Instructed the patient on follow-up requirements.

**Follow-Up:**  
Patient to return for further testing and evaluation to confirm diagnosis and adjust treatment plan as necessary.
