Both notes mention the onset of symptoms during university studies, the exacerbation of pain with studying, and the presence of headaches. They also describe the patient's past medical history, the initial working diagnosis, and the proposed chiropractic treatment. Additionally, both notes detail the patient's inability to perform certain activities due to severe abdominal pain, throat tightness, and headache, which have been present since a ballet class incident at age eight. The notes also discuss the reproduction of symptoms upon palpation around the xiphoid and the persistence of symptoms for several hours. However, the second note includes a plan for further diagnostic tests and follow-up instructions, which is not mentioned in the first note."}}
