**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents with a 4-year history of neck and thoracic spinal pain, which began during university studies. The pain exacerbates with studying, occurring approximately once a week and lasting for a couple of days. The patient also reports headaches described as a band of pain across the forehead, with additional ache at the base of the skull and in the temples. Past medical history is unremarkable except for shingles in 2004.

**Objective:**  
Routine physical examination was unremarkable. Initial working diagnosis was mid-back pain of mechanical origin with associated muscle hypertonicity. Chiropractic treatment was proposed, including SMT to spinal levels with restricted motion, soft-tissue treatment to the upper back musculature, and core stability exercises.

**Assessment:**  
Upon subsequent visit, the patient reported inability to lie prone on the treatment table or perform basic core stability exercises due to severe abdominal pain, throat tightness, and headache. These symptoms have been present since age eight, triggered by activities putting pressure on the abdomen. Symptoms originated from a ballet class incident at age eight, involving lying prone on a wooden floor and attempting to touch toes to the head while holding the ankle. Palpation around the xiphoid reproduces abdominal pain and throat tightness immediately, with headache onset a few minutes later, persisting for several hours. 

**Plan:**  
Diagnosis of xiphoid is considered. Further tests are required to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up instructions will be provided based on test results.

**Follow-Up:**  
Patient will be instructed on follow-up requirements after diagnostic tests are conducted.
