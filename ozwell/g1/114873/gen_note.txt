**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They have a history of juvenile nephronophthisis diagnosed at age 7, followed by initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). After 3 months on CAPD, the patient underwent a live related renal transplantation with their mother as the donor. Unfortunately, the patient experienced primary graft failure due to thrombosis of the graft renal artery and continued on CAPD. 

Approximately 18 months later, the patient had an episode of fungal peritonitis with Candida albicans isolated on culture, leading to the removal of the CAPD catheter and initiation of hemodialysis via a right internal jugular tunneled catheter. After 5 months, the patient developed a catheter-related bloodstream infection unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, resulting in the removal of the hemodialysis catheter and reinitiation of CAPD. 

Despite four exchanges with a 1 L dwell volume, the patient remained fluid overloaded, and a repeated peritoneal equilibration test (PET) showed high transporter status. With no permanent vascular access, the patient continued on CAPD with fluid restriction and high-dose diuretics, receiving occasional hemodialysis support through temporary vascular access. 

After 54 months of peritoneal dialysis, the patient began experiencing abdominal symptoms, including intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and abdominal distension. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed moderate ascites with septations, and the ascitic fluid study showed exudative ascites with predominant lymphocytes and negative adenosine deaminase. 

Given the high prevalence of tuberculosis and its similar presentation, antituberculous therapy was initiated, and CAPD was discontinued in favor of hemodialysis. However, after 2 months of therapy, the patient continued to experience progressive abdominal pain and distension. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast revealed prominent bowel loops with thickened peritoneum, and a barium meal follow-through showed a dilated small intestine mainly on the left side of the abdomen. 

Due to worsening abdominal symptoms, the patient underwent an explorative laparotomy, which revealed dense adhesions of bowel loops.

**Plan:**  
- Consult with colleagues to determine the next steps in management.  
- Continue monitoring the patient's symptoms and response to current treatment.  
- Consider further diagnostic evaluations or interventions as needed.
