They both describe the medical history and treatment journey of a 14-year-old male patient with juvenile nephronophthisis. Both notes detail the patient's initial treatment with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the subsequent renal transplantation and its failure, the episode of fungal peritonitis, the switch to hemodialysis, and the development of abdominal symptoms leading to a diagnosis of sclerosing peritonitis. They also mention the patient's current status post a successful deceased donor renal transplantation and ongoing treatment. The main difference is that the clinical note includes a subjective section with the patient's current report of feeling okay and a plan section outlining the physician's next steps."}}
