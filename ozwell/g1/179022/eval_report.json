Both describe the same patient's condition, medical history, examination findings, and the plan for treatment. They both mention the patient's chief complaint of bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand, the presence of giant fusiform aneurysms in both axillary arteries, and the challenges in finding appropriate-sized stents for endovascular closure. The main difference is in the presentation and structure of the information, but the content and details are consistent across both notes."}}
