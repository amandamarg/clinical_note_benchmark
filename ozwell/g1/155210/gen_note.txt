**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:33:32 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe right-sided facial pain for the past 6 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe right-sided facial pain for the past 6 months, triggered by drinking cold water. The pain is associated with numbness on the right side of the face. The patient had previously visited a dentist, who diagnosed decayed teeth as the cause of the pain, leading to the extraction of several right upper and lower teeth. The patient was also treated with antibiotics for gingivitis for an extended period. Two days prior to admission, the patient developed a tonic-clonic seizure.

**Neurological Examination:**  
- Bilateral papilledema observed.
- Mild paresthesia noted along the distribution area of the mandibular nerve, especially over the labial commissure.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- MRI revealed a large right temporal mass with nonhomogenous postcontrast enhancement, invading the wall of the right cavernous sinus, and spreading down to the right CPA.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
A right temporal craniotomy was performed. The solid fleshy tumor infiltrating the dura of the floor of the right temporal fossa and lateral wall of the cavernous sinus was resected as much as possible. The deepest part of the tumor was excised as a layer of the tumor infiltrating the surface of the cavernous sinus.

**Postoperative Imaging:**  
- CT scan and MRI showed a minimal residual tumor in the right CPA, located along the course of the right trigeminal nerve.

**Histopathological Examination:**  
- The tumor was identified as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).

**Postoperative Treatment:**  
- The patient received postoperative whole brain radiotherapy.

**Postoperative Course:**  
- The course was uneventful. The patient was pain-free 5 weeks after the surgery, but the numbness of the face persisted for another 6 months.

**Outcome:**  
- The patient unfortunately passed away 17 months after the surgery.

**Family Communication:**  
- The family has expressed a desire to speak with the physician, and arrangements will be made to facilitate this conversation.
