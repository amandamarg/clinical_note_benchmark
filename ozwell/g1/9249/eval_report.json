They both mention the patient's history of morbid obesity, large head circumference, family history of obesity and cancer, and the sleeve gastrectomy performed in 2014. Both notes also discuss the suspicion of a genetic cause for the obesity and the plan to conduct genetic analysis. However, the clinical note provides a more structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical history and genetic findings."}}
