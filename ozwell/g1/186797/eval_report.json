They both describe the clinical case of a 90-year-old diabetic woman who was admitted with sepsis, cough, and diffuse abdominal pain. Both notes detail the findings of mild leucocytosis, a thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis, and the incidental intraoperative discovery of a left-sided gallbladder during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. They also mention the retrospective analysis of a CT scan, the vascular and biliary reconstruction findings, and the postoperative complications of diabetes aggravation and basal pneumonia. The patient was discharged in good condition on postoperative day 16. The plan includes monitoring recovery and managing diabetes and respiratory symptoms."}}
