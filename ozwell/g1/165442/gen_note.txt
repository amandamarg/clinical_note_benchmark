**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:02:14 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with abdominal pain. The patient has a significant medical history of full thickness burn wounds sustained approximately 4 months ago after coming into contact with a high tension electric wire. The burns affected the right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall. The patient also experienced a perforation of the intestine with prolapse of intestinal loops through the abdominal wound. Initial management included the placement of a catheter drain through the open abdominal wound. The patient was referred to the plastic surgery unit in septic shock with an abdominal drain in place.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Full thickness burn wounds (right scapula, right upper limb, anterior abdominal wall)  
- Intestinal perforation with prolapse  
- Septic shock  
- Necrosis of burned skin and muscles (right shoulder and abdomen)  
- Enterocutaneous fistula (healed over 8 weeks)  
- Ventral hernia  

**Surgical History:**  
- Initial conservative management with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound, and culture-specific antibiotics.  
- Thorough debridement of necrotic skin over the right shoulder and upper arm followed by split skin grafting.  
- Abdominal wound covered with a skin graft.  
- Ventral hernia repair with synthetic mesh and abdominal wall reconstruction with flap cover.  
- Flap failure followed by debridement and application of two random pattern transposition skin flaps from the right upper abdomen and left lower abdomen.  

**Plan:**  
The patient is here today for the reconstruction of a ventral hernia. The plan is to repair the ventral hernia by applying a synthetic mesh and reconstructing the abdominal wall with a flap cover. During the operation, the abdominal skin graft was separated from the peritoneum and the underlying omentum, and an inlay composite mesh was applied to secure the abdominal wall. After the flap failed, the area was debrided, and two random pattern transposition skin flaps were applied, one from the right upper abdomen and another from the left lower abdomen.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, likely related to the ventral hernia and previous surgical interventions. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address the current symptoms and ensure proper healing and recovery.
