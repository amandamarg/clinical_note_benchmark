They both describe the case of a 60-year-old male patient with a history of pain and discharge in the upper left jaw, which persisted after the extraction of maxillary molars. Both notes mention the patient's history of hypertension and smoking, the findings from the extraoral and intraoral examinations, the CT scan results, and the histopathological examination. They also both conclude with a diagnosis of ADCC (cribriform pattern) and describe the treatment plan involving surgical excision and post-radiotherapy. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the histopathological findings and the staging of the cancer, while the second note focuses more on the clinical examination and the plan for follow-up."}}
