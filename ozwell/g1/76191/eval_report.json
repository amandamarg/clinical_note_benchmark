They both describe the medical case of a 59-year-old female patient who suffered a fracture of the neck of the humerus with complications involving the left axillary artery due to blunt trauma. Both notes detail the patient's medical history of diabetes and hypertension, the diagnostic findings of a monophasic flow in the upper limb arteries, and the complete occlusion of the left axillary artery. They also describe the surgical intervention, including the fixation of the fracture and the repair of the axillary artery using a reversed basilic vein graft. Postoperative findings and the positive outcome of the surgery are also consistent in both notes."}}
