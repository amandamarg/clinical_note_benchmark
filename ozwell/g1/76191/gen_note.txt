**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:08:07 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Fracture in the left arm requiring surgery.  
- **Medical History:** Diabetes and hypertension.  

**Clinical Findings and Diagnostic Studies:**  
- **Fracture:** Neck of the humerus caused by blunt trauma.  
- **Color Doppler Study:** Monophasic flow in upper limb arteries, suggesting a proximal occlusion.  
- **CT Angiogram:** Complete occlusion of the left axillary artery by the sharp edge of the fractured humerus with distal filling of the brachial artery through collaterals.  
- **Physical Examination:** Absent pulsations in the upper limb, but capillary refilling was present.  

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- **Procedure:** Urgent surgical intervention was performed, including fixation of the fracture and repair of the axillary artery.  
- **Orthopedic Surgery:** Open reduction and fixation of the neck of the humerus through a longitudinal incision over the anterolateral aspect of the left shoulder.  
- **Vascular Surgery:** Exploration of the axillary artery in the left axilla through a separate incision.  
  - The axillary artery was contused for a segment of approximately 8 cm.  
  - No associated nerve injury was found, and the basilic vein was intact.  
  - The contused segment of the axillary artery was excised, and the basilic vein was harvested through the same incision.  
  - The axillary artery was repaired using a reversed basilic vein graft in an end-to-end fashion with 6-0 polypropylene sutures.  

**Postoperative Findings:**  
- Pulsations were present in the left upper limb post-procedure.  
- No evidence of compartment syndrome or edema, so fasciotomy was not required.  
- Total duration of the procedure was approximately three hours.  

**Outcome:**  
The patient recovered well post-surgery.
