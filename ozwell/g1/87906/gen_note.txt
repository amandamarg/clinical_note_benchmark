**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:32:35 PM  

**Patient History:**

The patient presented with minor respiratory symptoms, including a cough and trouble breathing, which began a few days ago. Initially, these symptoms were minor but progressed into a more serious pulmonary disease with progressive respiratory distress. The patient was admitted to an outside hospital 2 days prior to the current hospitalization.

**Previous Hospitalization:**

- **Chest CT Findings:** Diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial lung infiltrates.
- **Diagnosis:** Atypical pneumonia and possible myocarditis.
- **Treatment:** Antibiotics were administered.
- **Outcome:** The patient was discharged after two weeks, but dyspnea persisted, leading to admission to our hospital for further evaluation.

**Current Hospitalization:**

Upon admission, the patient experienced fever, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and irregular heartbeats with bouts of ventricular fibrillation. Additional findings included acute renal failure and possible liver disease, marked by elevated liver function tests. A CT scan revealed a poorly defined pancreatic mass.

**Head CT (without contrast):**

- Minimal mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
- Opacification of several left ethmoid air cells with fluid levels in the left sphenoid and left maxillary sinuses.
- No mass lesion, erosion, or bone destruction in the nasal cavity; findings consistent with mild inflammatory changes.

**Suspected Sepsis:**

The patient was treated with antibiotics, but there was no improvement in the condition. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated with progressive dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates involving all five lobes, as seen on X-ray examination.

**Microbiological Studies:**

- Positive for a mildly increased DNA load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the blood, detected by a quantitative PCR assay.
- Positive EBV capsid IgG and nuclear antigen/antibody.
- Peripheral blood smear showed mild normocytic anemia with moderate thrombocytopenia.
- White cell count was within the normal range, but there was absolute lymphopenia with no atypical lymphocytes or lymphoma cells.

**Current Status:**

As the patient's condition deteriorated, signs of cardiac tamponade developed. Further evaluation and management are ongoing.
