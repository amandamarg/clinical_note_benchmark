**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Reason for Visit:** Regular checkup

**Findings:**
- Initial examination revealed a small nodule in the right lung.
- CT scan indicated a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in the right lung.
- Biopsy samples were too small for a definitive diagnosis, but multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor were suspected.
- Five years later, CT scan showed a slight increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule and the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

**Procedures:**
- Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed for the pulmonary lesion.
- Curettage of the lytic bone lesion was conducted.
- During surgery, the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. The vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and not connected to the spinal canal.

**Postoperative Course:**
- The patient made good postoperative progress.
- No significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were observed during the clinical course, even with imaging examinations such as CT and MR imaging.
- The patient has remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.

**Plan:**
- Continue to monitor the patient closely for any changes or developments.
- The patient is advised to contact the clinic with any concerns or questions.

**Conclusion:**
The patient has shown good recovery and remains disease-free following the surgical interventions. Further monitoring will be essential to ensure continued health and address any potential issues promptly.
