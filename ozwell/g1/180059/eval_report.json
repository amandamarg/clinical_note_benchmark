Both describe the medical history and findings of a 40-year-old Asian woman who was found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung and a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone. They detail the initial suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, the procedures performed (video-assisted thoracic surgery and curettage), and the postoperative course. Both notes conclude with the patient being disease-free 41 months after the operation and emphasize the importance of continued monitoring."}}
