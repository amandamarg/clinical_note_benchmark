They both describe the case of a 61-year-old female patient with recurrent lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma in the right side of the mandible. Both notes detail the planned segmental resection of the mandible, including the use of a 3D model for surgical simulation and preparation, the design and use of a surgical device to guide bone cutting, and the fixation of a pre-bent titanium reconstruction plate. The surgical procedure and follow-up instructions are also consistent between the two notes."}}
