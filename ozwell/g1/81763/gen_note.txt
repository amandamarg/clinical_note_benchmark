**Age:** [Patient's Age]  
**Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient reports bilateral hip and knee joint pain on walking, with a progressive limitation in the range of hip motion and walking ability distance.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient states that the symptoms began at age 45 with an incident of low back pain, recurring at ages 50 and 52. Each episode was relieved by conventional bed rest and other conservative measures. The patient has progressive changes in the lumbar spine, including discopathies and stenosis of the spinal canal, contributing to the limitation of walking ability over the last 10 years.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Right nasolacrimal stenosis, operated on twice at ages 3 and 8.
- Right inguinal hernia, operated on twice at ages 1 and 3.
- Suspected dentine dysplasia with hypermobility and spontaneous dental abscesses, resulting in the loss of all teeth between ages 22 to 27.
- Unsuccessful closed reduction of the left hip joint at age 11, resulting in immobilization in a spica cast for 9 months.
- Night bedwetting up to age 11 due to urinary reflux, evolving into left renal regression and hypoplasia, diagnosed by renal angiography at age 22.
- Ingrown toenail since adolescence with multiple recurrences post-surgical correction.
- Two attacks of left ear Meniere's disease at ages 33 and 44.

**Family History:**  
The patient was born into a large family from a second-degree consanguineous traditional marriage. The mother was 43 at the time of the patient's birth. The patient has 3 sisters and 4 brothers, none of whom have hip disease.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
Based on the patient's history and current symptoms, staged bilateral total hip arthroplasties are recommended to address the hip joint pain and progressive limitation in range of motion. Post-surgical follow-up with physical therapy will be necessary to regain range of motion and strength.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for the arthroplasties and subsequent physical therapy sessions. Further monitoring and evaluation will be conducted as needed.
