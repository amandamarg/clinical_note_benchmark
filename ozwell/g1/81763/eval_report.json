Both notes mention the patient's chief complaints of bilateral hip and knee joint pain, progressive limitation in hip motion, and walking ability. They also detail the patient's past medical history, including surgeries for right nasolacrimal stenosis and right inguinal hernia, suspected dentine dysplasia, unsuccessful closed reduction of the left hip joint, urinary reflux leading to left renal regression, ingrown toenail issues, and Meniere's disease. The family history of a large family from a consanguineous marriage is also noted. Both notes conclude with the recommendation for staged bilateral total hip arthroplasties and the need for post-surgical physical therapy."}}
