Both describe the same clinical scenario involving a 50-year-old male with a history of chronic cocaine abuse who was found unresponsive and treated in the emergency department. They detail the patient's initial condition, vital signs, physical examination findings, diagnostic studies, interventions, procedures, and outcomes.
