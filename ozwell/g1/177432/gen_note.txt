**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:31:24 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** Born with bladder exstrophy, multiple surgeries including cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5. Recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood. No major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy. No family history of colorectal disease.

**Presenting Complaints:**  
- Rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit for 6 months, passing mucus, and increased stool frequency. No abdominal pain or weight changes.

**Colonoscopy Findings:**  
- Two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon with irregular patterns suggestive of focally advanced disease. Polyps were removed and histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion. Atypical mucosa around a diverticulum-like structure noted, not adenomatous. No other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- Due to difficult endoscopic access and suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgery, a high anterior resection was performed via an open approach. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request. During laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was found adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind ending tube emerged from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon, marked for pathological identification.

**Post-operative Course:**  
- Uneventful recovery. Patient reports good quality of life following surgery and expressed desire for a permanent colostomy.

**Plan:**  
- No immediate follow-up appointments scheduled. Patient advised to contact the clinic with any further concerns or questions.
