Both notes mention her past medical history of bladder exstrophy, multiple surgeries, and recurrent urinary tract infections. They also describe the colonoscopy findings of two large sessile polyps with dysplasia in the sigmoid colon, the decision for surgical intervention, and the formation of an end colostomy. The notes highlight the patient's uneventful recovery and good quality of life post-surgery. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more structured with headings like \"Subjective,\" \"Objective,\" \"Assessment,\" and \"Plan.\""}}
