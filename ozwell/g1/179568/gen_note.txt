**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:35 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling nervous about ongoing ankle pain. The pain has been present for approximately 2 months and is recurrent, accompanied by swelling and edema. The patient has a history of thyroid follicular adenocarcinoma, treated 25 years ago with total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment. The patient experienced a calcaneal mass 12 years post-surgery and a proximal tibial mass 10 years after that, both identified as delayed metastases of the same pathology.

**Objective:**  
15 years ago, the patient presented with mild edema and intermittent pain upon daily activity in the ankle, without cutaneous lesions. Imaging at that time included plain radiographs showing a 3-centimeter oval lytic lesion in the anterior aspect of the calcaneum. An MRI revealed a 3.2 cm well-defined benign-looking lytic lesion of the calcaneal neck reaching the cortex, mildly irregular, with mild degenerative disease of the posterior subtalar joint, consistent with an intraosseous ganglion cyst of the calcaneus.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was initially treated with NSAIDs, paracetamol, partial weight bearing, and relative rest, but showed no improvement after 4 weeks. Surgical intervention was performed, resecting the cyst with a margin of surrounding fibro-osseous tissue and grafting the bone. Histopathological evaluation confirmed metastatic carcinoma of the thyroid gland, with cells expressing cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and thyroglobulin. The pathology slides from the recent excision were compared to those from the thyroid excision 12 years prior, confirming the same pathology.

**Plan:**  
Monitor the patient's condition closely with regular follow-up appointments to ensure optimal care. Maintain communication with the patient and their family to stay updated on any changes in the patient's condition.
