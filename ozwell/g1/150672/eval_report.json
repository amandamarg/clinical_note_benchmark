Both describe the case of an 83-year-old female patient with a history of squamous cell skin cancer in the left mandibular region, which recurred and presented as a large ulcerated nodule in the left cheek and neck region. They both detail the patient's socioeconomic challenges, the decision against radiotherapy, and the subsequent treatment with cetuximab due to the patient's poor clinical status. The notes also describe the treatment course, including the development of a grade 2 acneiform rash and grade 3 anemia, and the patient's decision to stop treatment after 6 months. Finally, both notes mention that the patient was in complete clinical remission at the last follow-up visit, 12 months after the end of cetuximab therapy."}}
