They both mention the patient's initial symptoms of chest and back pain, the ineffectiveness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the findings from the CTA of the aorta. Both notes detail the thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) procedure, including the use of a stent graft and the successful outcome with no perfusion of the false lumen. They also mention the patient's stable condition post-surgery and the plan for follow-up care. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more structured with sections like Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, and Follow-up."}}
