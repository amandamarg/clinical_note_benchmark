Both provide a detailed account of the patient's medical history, including her history of subvalvular membranous aortic stenosis, surgical interventions, and the Morrow and Konno procedures. They also describe her pregnancy, the monitoring she received, the development of dyspnoea, weight gain, and the eventual delivery of her child. Postpartum, both notes mention her admission for bradycardia, the insertion of a DDDR pacemaker, and the enlargement of her LV diameters. The conclusion in both notes highlights the suboptimal care she received in the last weeks of her pregnancy and the importance of adequate organization of care with skilled multidisciplinary teams."}}
