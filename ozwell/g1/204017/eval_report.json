Both describe the case of a 56-year-old male patient with a persistent orocutaneous fistula following the removal of a plasmacytoma from the medial side of the left mandible three years ago. They both mention previous unsuccessful attempts to close the fistula and the decision to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect. The surgical procedure, including the excision of the fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, and mobilization of the submandibular gland, is detailed in both notes. The postoperative care and follow-up plans are also consistent across the notes."}}
