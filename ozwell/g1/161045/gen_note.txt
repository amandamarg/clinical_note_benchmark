**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:12:30 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Mass on left wrist  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a mass on the left wrist, which started 4 months ago and has been growing rapidly in the last month. The patient reports numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. There is no family history of note, and the patient is not on any medications.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
- **Ultrasound:** Revealed a large, complex cystic structure within the carpal tunnel.  
- **MRI:** Showed a heterogeneous, well-defined mass with fluid and solid components, appearing to arise from the tendon sheath of the middle and ring finger flexors. The mass was located in the middle and ring fingers with dimensions of 19 x 24 x 38 mm. It showed peripheral enhancement and areas of necrosis, with no flow void. The median nerve had a normal appearance.

**Provisional Diagnosis:**  
In light of the clinical history and radiological features, a malignant lesion such as synovial sarcoma was considered the likely provisional diagnosis.

**Physical Examination:**  
On examination, the patient had a mobile and palpable mass which moved from the mid palm to the volar wrist region with flexion and extension of the wrist. The mass was not adherent to the overlying skin. The patient had full power in the left hand with no thenar muscle wasting. There was decreased sensation in the thumb, index, and middle finger, and Tinel's test was negative.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient underwent surgical exploration and removal of the tumor within one week of the consultation. An extended carpal tunnel incision was made from the mid palm to the volar wrist. After the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) was divided, a large tan-colored soft-tissue tumor was visible on the ulnar aspect of the median nerve.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to assess the patient's recovery and progress post-surgery.
