They both describe the case of a 34-year-old male chef with a mass on his left wrist, which had been present for 4 months and grew rapidly in the last month. Both notes mention numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and no significant family history or medications. They describe the diagnostic imaging findings, including ultrasound and MRI results, and the provisional diagnosis of a malignant lesion such as synovial sarcoma. The physical examination findings are consistent, noting a mobile and palpable mass, full power in the left hand, and decreased sensation in certain fingers. Both notes detail the surgical intervention, including the incision and tumor removal, and mention the post-operative recovery and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the first note includes more detailed information about the surgical findings and histological analysis, confirming the diagnosis of a synovial haemangioma."}}
