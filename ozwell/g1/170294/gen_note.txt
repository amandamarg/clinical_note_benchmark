**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:19 PM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Mass on left ring finger growing for seven months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a mass on the left ring finger that has been growing for seven months. The patient denies any trauma to the finger prior to the appearance of the mass. The patient has no medical or drug history. The patient initially sought medical attention two months after the mass appeared and underwent incision and drainage, which did not result in improvement.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Mass located over the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of the left ring finger with extensive involvement of the 4th web space.  
- Overlying skin coverage is ulcerative with no active signs of infection.  
- Range of motion of the involved digit is limited.  
- Neurovascular examination is normal.

**Radiological Evaluation:**  
- Soft tissue swelling with no evidence of bone involvement.  
- MRI showed a mass on the volar aspect of the ring finger encasing about 50% of the flexor tendons of that digit.  
- Low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 evaluation with strong enhancement in post-contrast evaluation.  
- Partial abutment of the radial sided bundle and complete encirclement of the ulnar sided neurovascular bundle.  
- Surrounding bone free of any masses and associated mass effect.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient was taken to the OR for exploration and mass excision. Intraoperative findings included an extensive mass encircling the ulnar neurovascular bundle with mass abutment over the radial bundle, consistent with pre-op assessment. The mass was dissected freely.

**Discussion and Plan:**  
The possible risks associated with the intervention were explained to the patient prior to the operation. The patient is advised to attend all scheduled follow-up appointments for monitoring progress post-surgery.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient did not express any questions or concerns at this time.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is to be monitored and follow-up appointments are scheduled to assess recovery and progress post-surgery.
