Both notes detail the patient's history, including the initial appearance of the lesion, its growth, and the recent symptoms of heat and tenderness in the right breast. They both mention the patient's tobacco use and the physical examination findings of an erythematous and rigid right breast with a 2.2 cm lesion and yellow pus drainage.\n\nBoth notes also describe the diagnostic studies performed, including the shave biopsy, MRI, and wedge biopsy, and the findings of verrucous histologic features, chronic inflammation, and HPV L1 capsid protein positivity. They both outline the plan for wide excision of the lesion and the final histologic examination results confirming a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with verrucous features.\n\nThe main difference is that the second note includes an outcome stating that the patient has unfortunately passed away, which is not mentioned in the first note."}}
