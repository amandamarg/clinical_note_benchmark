**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:02:39 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Progressive worsening of vision over the past seven years.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a progressive decline in vision over the past seven years. There are no accompanying symptoms such as nystagmus or photophobia. The patient has a history of trauma to the right eye at age 14, with vision stabilizing at 20/40 post-trauma. No systemic abnormalities or malformations have been recorded.  

**Family History:**  
The patient's mother was diagnosed with diffuse corneal opacities of unknown etiology in both eyes three years ago, with decreased vision since childhood but no significant impact on daily life. The patient's father had no ophthalmic abnormalities before his death. The patient's brother and sister have no symptoms or ophthalmic or systemic abnormalities.  

**Examination:**  
- **Visual Acuity:** Best-corrected vision is 20/400 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye.  
- **Intraocular Pressure:** 25 mmHg in the right eye and 23 mmHg in the left eye.  
- **Slit Lamp Examination:** Diffuse haze throughout the entire cornea with a flaky pattern of stroma. The right eye shows decreased vision and relatively denser homogenous opacities compared to the left.  
- **Endothelium and Descemet's Membrane:** Normal in the right eye. No gross abnormalities such as Haab's striae or features of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy detected.  
- **Specular Microscopy (Past Records):** Normal shape and numbers of endothelial cells in both eyes six years ago, with some indeterminate forms noted currently.  

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The findings suggest the need for further testing to determine the cause of the patient's vision problems. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled for additional evaluation and testing.
