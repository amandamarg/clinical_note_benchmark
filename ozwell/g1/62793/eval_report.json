They both describe the case of a 45-year-old male with end-stage renal disease due to chronic glomerulonephritis who started automated peritoneal dialysis in February 2015. Both notes mention the patient presenting with nausea and cloudy peritoneal fluid, a peritoneal effluent white cell count of 996 cells/mL with a polymorphonuclear cell fraction of 56%, and a culture growing coagulase-negative staphylococcus resistant to beta-lactams but sensitive to vancomycin. They both describe the treatment with IP vancomycin and ceftazidime, the discontinuation of ceftazidime, and the continuation of vancomycin with levels kept high due to an upcoming kidney transplant. Both notes also detail the patient's presentation with general malaise, a skin rash, hypotension, and the subsequent diagnosis of DRESS syndrome, followed by treatment with corticosteroids and eventual discharge in stable condition. The main difference is in the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other a more narrative description."}}
