They both describe the case of a 67-year-old male patient with symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness, headache, hearing loss, and aural pressure in the left ear, along with aural discharge. Both notes mention the patient's medical history of hypertension and diabetes, and the absence of relevant family history. The examination findings, imaging results, diagnosis, and treatment details are consistent across both notes. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's condition and treatment, while the second note is a concise clinical summary."}}
