**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:37:42 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Age:** 19 years old  
- **Medical History:** No significant medical history.  
- **Dental History:** History of dental trauma 2 years ago, resulting in fractured anterior teeth and right upper and lower central incisors. Underwent root canal therapy and crown placement on both teeth.  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with a complaint regarding the appearance of gums and front teeth, specifically noting a defect in the gums related to the lower front teeth.

**History of Present Illness:**  
- The patient first noticed the defect approximately one year ago.  
- Initially asymptomatic for a year following dental treatment for trauma.  
- Previous treatment for the defect included dental scaling and advice to massage gums with chlorhexidine gel.  

**Examination:**  
- Oral hygiene is fair.  
- Lower right central incisor has a dislodged porcelain-fused-to-metal crown.  
- Mucosal with alveolar bone fenestration observed on the labial surface in relation to the lower right mandibular central incisor.  
- Portion of the root is visible through the defect.  
- Fenestration measures approximately 5 mm Ã— 3 mm in diameter.  
- No periodontal pocket, no mobility, and no communication of fenestration with the gingival sulcus on periodontal probing.  
- Transgingival probing or bone sounding under local anesthetic infiltration suggests probable loss of alveolar bone along the length of the root facially.  
- Intraoral periapical radiograph shows the concerned tooth slightly under obturated with diffuse radiolucency around its root.  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Plan for repeat endodontic therapy in the affected tooth.  
- Followed by periodontal surgical correction by raising a full-thickness flap.  
- Patient advised to return for a follow-up session after the first sitting.
