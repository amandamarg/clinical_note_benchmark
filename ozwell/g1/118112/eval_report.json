They both describe the case of a 40-year-old male patient with a large mass in the left arm and shoulder, which was diagnosed as Chondrosarcoma. Both notes detail the history of the present illness, including the patient's initial presentation with a small swelling three years ago, his fear of surgery, and subsequent treatment by bone setters. They also describe the physical examination findings, measurements and tests conducted, and the assessment and plan for treatment, which includes a forequarter amputation. The surgical procedure is outlined in both notes, and the outcome at the three-year follow-up is mentioned. Overall, the notes convey the same information about the patient's condition and treatment plan."}}
