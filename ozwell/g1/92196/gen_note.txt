**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:39:12 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Painless enlargement of the right parotid gland for one year.  
- Facial asymmetry for one week.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a one-year history of painless enlargement of the right parotid gland and a one-week history of facial asymmetry. The patient reports that the right side of the face appears uneven and there is an inability to move the right side of the face. The enlargement of the parotid gland has been progressively increasing in size over the past year.

**Medical History:**  
- No other medical conditions reported.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Firm mass 2 Ã— 3 cm in diameter in the region of the right parotid gland.  
- Right facial nerve paralysis observed.  
- Mass is fixed upon palpation.  
- Palpable right cervical lymph node.  
- Normal body temperature.  
- Normal complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemistry.

**Investigations:**  
- Granulomatous infections and autoimmune disorders were ruled out; results were negative.  
- MRI showed enlargement of the right parotid gland with evidence of multiple cystic masses involving both the superficial and deep portions of the gland.  
- Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: Cytopathological examination suggested adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) with large globules of the extracellular matrix, partially surrounded by basaloid tumour cells but lacking characteristic globules.

**Planned Procedure:**  
- Radical parotidectomy and modified radical neck dissection with spinal accessory nerve preservation under general anesthesia.  
- Preauricular incision curving under the ear lobule in extension with the neck dissection incision.  
- Skin subcutaneous flap to be raised over the parotid until the distal branches of the facial nerve are seen to exit the gland.  
- Mandibular, buccal, and zygomatic branches to be incised and tagged with fine silk sutures for later grafting.  
- Mastoidectomy to be performed to identify the main trunk of the facial nerve, increase the length of the proximal nerve stump for grafting, and provide adequate surgical margin.  
- Extensive resection to remove the parotid neoplasm.  
- Frozen sections from the facial nerve to confirm uninvolved nerve margins.  
- Modified neck dissection to be added post-resection.  
- Donor nerve graft to be prepared from the great auricular nerve.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
- The patient did not express any questions or concerns about the procedure.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule the procedure as discussed.  
- Advise the patient to return with any questions or concerns.
