They both describe the case of a 14-year-old female with a year's history of painless enlargement of the right parotid gland and a week's history of facial asymmetry. Both notes detail the physical examination findings, including a firm mass in the parotid gland region, right facial nerve paralysis, and a palpable right cervical lymph node. They also mention the normal body temperature and blood test results. The investigations, including ruling out granulomatous infections and autoimmune disorders, MRI findings, and FNA biopsy results suggesting adenoid cystic carcinoma, are consistent in both notes. The planned procedure, including radical parotidectomy, modified radical neck dissection, and nerve grafting, is described in both notes. The patient's lack of questions or concerns and the plan to schedule the procedure are also mentioned in both notes."}}
