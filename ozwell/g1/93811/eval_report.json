Both notes detail the injury, initial management, diagnostic tests, assessment, and treatment plan. They mention the severe pain, swelling, and haematoma formation in the rectus femoris muscles, as well as the conservative treatment approach involving rest, compression, ice application, and pain management. The notes also highlight the absence of fractures or compartment syndrome and the normal coagulation profile. Overall, the notes are very similar, providing consistent information about the patient's condition and treatment."}}
