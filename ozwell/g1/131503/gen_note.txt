**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe pain in the neck and right arm.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports severe pain spreading from the neck to the right arm, accompanied by numbness in the first and second fingers of the right hand. The symptoms began 10 days after a minor trauma from a fall on the back, which occurred 20 days ago. The pain has progressively worsened since onset.

**Radiological Findings:**  
- Compression on the spinal canal and deterioration of the cervical lordosis due to height loss in the C6 vertebra corpus.
- A large mass with a diameter of 10 cm was identified in the left kidney on abdominal CT images.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
A cervical sixth vertebrae corpectomy was performed through the anterior approach without delay due to severe pain. A 7â€“8 cm bone autograft was harvested from the middle section of the right leg fibula and placed in the gap created after the corpectomy. The lordosis was restored, and the graft was secured with an anterior plaque to minimize the risk of displacement.

**Postoperative Care:**  
Postoperative cervical vertebra was monitored using lateral cervical X-ray and CT. The patient experienced leg pain postoperatively, which did not hinder mobilization on the first day. Notably, radicular pain in the neck and arm improved by the first postoperative day.

**Plan:**  
Continue to monitor the patient's condition and ensure proper recovery. The patient was advised to return if any concerns arise.

**Patient Inquiries:**  
The patient had no further questions at this time.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up as needed for any concerns or complications.
