Both provide detailed information about a 29-year-old mother diagnosed with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, her treatment with sirolimus, and her two pregnancies while on this medication. They cover her medical history, family and social history, prenatal care, pregnancy history, delivery, and neonatal history. Both notes mention the significant resolution of cutaneous lesions with sirolimus, the flare-up upon discontinuation, and the outcomes of her pregnancies, including the birth weights and Apgar scores of her children. The plan to continue sirolimus therapy is also consistent in both notes."}}
