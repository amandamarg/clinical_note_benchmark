**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was diagnosed with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome over five years ago and has been treated with oral sirolimus 2mg twice daily. The patient reports significant resolution of cutaneous lesions at 6 months follow-up. However, there was a flare-up of lesions upon discontinuation of treatment before preconception.

- Regular blood investigations showed normal complete blood count, liver and renal functions, sugar, and lipid profile.  
- Routine antenatal checkups at the rural health care center were uneventful, with normal blood pressure, maternal weight gain, height of fundus corresponding to gestational age, and normal hemoglobin level.  
- A fetal ultrasound at 36 weeks revealed a single live fetus with adequate amniotic fluid and expected fetal weight corresponding to 34 weeks.  
- Due to the patient's medical condition, sirolimus therapy, and suspected fetal growth restriction, the patient was referred to a tertiary hospital.
