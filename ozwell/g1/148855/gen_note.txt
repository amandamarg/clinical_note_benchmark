**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Examination of the left shoulder due to suspected fracture.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with concerns of a possible fracture in the left shoulder. Initial X-ray imaging revealed an osteolytic tumor in the proximal part of the left humerus with destruction of the cortex at the greater tuberosity. Subsequent MRI showed a heterogeneous tumor, approximately 4 by 6 cm, with enhancement on T1 sequences post-contrast administration and a periosteal reaction at the distal part of the tumor. These findings raised suspicion of malignancy.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Left-sided hemi-thyroidectomy 2 years ago for a 5 cm follicular adenoma.
- Malignant melanoma excised from the left upper arm 8 years ago.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Whole-body PET-CT confirmed a malignant tumor in the proximal left humerus with cortical destruction at the greater tuberosity. A fat layer was noted separating the tumor from surrounding soft tissue, indicating confinement to the bone.
- A small lymph node at the angle of the left mandible was suspected to be malignant, but biopsy was not feasible due to size and location.
- Ultrasound-guided histological biopsy of the left humerus tumor revealed carcinoma with morphology and immunohistochemical profile indicative of metastasis from the thyroid gland. The presence of oncocytes was noted.

**Surgical Interventions:**  
- Thyroidectomy of the right side and isthmus of the gland.
- Excision of lymph nodes on the right side of the neck.
- Excision of the PET-positive lymph node on the left side of the neck.

**Pathology Results:**  
None of the excised tissues contained malignancy.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The findings suggest metastatic spread from the thyroid gland to the left humerus. Despite the absence of malignancy in the excised tissues, continued monitoring is necessary to ensure the primary cancer does not recur. Further follow-up and management will be based on ongoing assessments and imaging results.
