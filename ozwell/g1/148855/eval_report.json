Both describe the medical case of a 64-year-old man with a suspected fracture in the left shoulder, which led to the discovery of an osteolytic tumor in the proximal part of the left humerus. They detail the patient's past medical history, including a left-sided hemi-thyroidectomy for a follicular adenoma and a malignant melanoma excised from the left upper arm. Both notes mention the diagnostic studies performed, including X-ray, MRI, and PET-CT, and the findings of a carcinoma with morphology indicative of metastasis from the thyroid gland. They also describe the surgical interventions undertaken and the pathology results, which showed no malignancy in the excised tissues. Finally, both notes conclude with an assessment and plan for continued monitoring and management of the patient's condition."}}
