Both describe a 32-year-old female patient with severe pain in the right temporomandibular joint and right ear, mouth opening limitation, and facial asymmetry. They both mention the patient's history of progressive enlargement of the right cheek and differing eyelid width since shortly after birth, with no perinatal problems or notable postnatal illness. The physical examination findings in both notes include enlargement of the right side of the mandible, asymmetry of the tongue, and larger teeth on the affected side. Both notes also mention additional symptoms such as clicking in the left TMJ, difficulty in chewing, and headaches on the right side. The assessment and plan in both notes suggest further evaluation and imaging, with a referral to a specialist for comprehensive management."}}
