Both describe the same patient's condition, history, and treatment. They detail the patient's chief complaint of pain and growth in the mouth, the history of a road traffic accident, and the subsequent development of the growth. The physical examination findings, diagnostic imaging results, and the surgical approach used to excise the lesion are also consistent between the two notes. Additionally, both notes mention the histopathological examination results and the follow-up plan. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific wording used in each note."}}
