**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Sudden pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing sudden pain in the right upper quadrant that started a few days ago and worsened prior to admission to the hospital. The pain is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient's medical history is unremarkable.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- The patient appeared pale and in distress.
- Vital signs: Blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 40.
- Abdominal examination revealed pain with guarding and rebound in all four quadrants.

**Laboratory Tests:**  
- Hemoglobin (Hb): 69 g/dL
- White Blood Cell count (WBC): 15,000 Î¼L

**Imaging Studies:**  
- FAST ultrasound: An 8x5 cm lesion in segments V and VI of the liver with diffuse hemoperitoneum.
- Emergency abdominal CT scan: Evidence of an 8x5 cm ruptured hepatic lesion with massive hemoperitoneum and leakage of contrast medium. The lesion had a large extrahepatic component with possible invasion of the hepatoduodenal ligament and gallbladder.

**Clinical Course:**  
During the CT scan, the patient became clinically unstable, necessitating emergency surgery. A Chevron incision was performed to access the abdomen. The liver was packed, and a Pringle maneuver was used to achieve hepatic inflow occlusion and slow down the bleeding. Three liters of blood were aspirated from the abdominal cavity. The bleeding mass in the liver was inspected and found to be invading the hepatoduodenal ligament and extending into but not penetrating the second part of the duodenum. No other visible masses were seen in the liver or peritoneal cavity. A resection of segments V and VI of the liver en bloc with the gallbladder was performed using a LigaSure device.

**Plan:**  
The patient will remain in the hospital for a few days for monitoring and recovery. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks to assess progress.
