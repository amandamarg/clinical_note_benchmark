Both notes mention the initial puncture wound by a nail 11 years ago, the development of a popliteal pseudoaneurysm, the surgical excision and repair of the popliteal artery, the recurrence of the mass, and the current presentation with a large popliteal mass and obstructed artery. They also both include details from physical examinations, imaging studies, and the assessment and plan for surgical intervention. The main difference is in the level of detail and specific wording used in each note."}}
