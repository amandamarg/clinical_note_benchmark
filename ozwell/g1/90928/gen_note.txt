**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. [Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Dog bite to the face.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with multiple facial lacerations resulting from a dog bite that occurred 30 minutes prior to the initial examination. The affected areas included the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eyelid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek, and over the left body of the mandible. The patient was initially examined by emergency physicians who found no additional wounds. Due to distress, an intra-oral examination was not performed. No radiographic investigation was conducted as the injury was presumed to be limited to soft tissue.

**Initial Treatment:**  
Facial wounds were cleaned with aqueous iodine solution. The patient was started on an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An ophthalmologist examination revealed no ocular injury.

**Subsequent Management:**  
The patient was transferred to our unit the following day and fasted in preparation for an examination under general anaesthesia and primary closure of facial lacerations. During the procedure, an open fracture of the left mandible consistent with a dog bite was discovered. The fracture was treated via a trans-oral approach using a five-hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. Facial lacerations were copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed with fine nylon sutures.

**Follow-Up and Outcomes:**  
The patient was discharged home the next day. Seven days post-operation, the patient attended for suture removal under general anaesthetic and examination of the jaw, which showed well-healing facial wounds and no movement at the fracture site. Ten weeks after the initial operation, the patient was admitted for removal of the mandibular plate under general anaesthetic, which revealed good bony union and the plate was removed without complications.

**Plan:**  
The patient will continue to be reviewed in the clinic to monitor dentition.
