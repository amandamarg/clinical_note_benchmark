**Time:** 7:12 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in both hip joints and the left ankle. The pain has been persistent for a while. The patient recently underwent a 2-week training program at a marine training center, which included 2-3 hours of swimming training per day and 2 hours of basic physical strength reinforcement training. The swimming training consisted of 50 minutes of swimming followed by 10 minutes of rest, with intervals of high and low-speed swimming. The physical strength training involved walking, running, and weight training for upper and lower extremity muscular strength. The difficulty level was consistent with that of the patient's colleagues.

**Objective:**  
The patient visited a private clinic due to the pain, where a simple radiological examination showed no abnormal findings. Anti-inflammatory analgesics were prescribed, and immobilization was recommended. The patient presented at our hospital 4 weeks after enrollment due to the aggravation of right hip joint symptoms. Radiographs revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture. A bone scan showed hot uptakes at both hips and the left ankle joint. MRI revealed fractures of both femoral necks, with the right side being a displaced and complete fracture.

**Assessment:**  
- Displaced femoral neck fracture (right side)
- Fractures of both femoral necks
- Slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint
- Diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus

**Plan:**  
The right hip joint was treated with open reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws. The left hip and ankle joint were treated conservatively with stabilization and long leg casting. A reduction loss was noted 2 weeks after treatment. The patient did not make any specific complaints regarding the ankle joint. Further examination and tests are required to determine the best course of action. The patient is advised to return in a few days for follow-up.
