The first note is a detailed surgical report, providing an in-depth account of the patient's condition, diagnostic findings, surgical procedures, and outcomes. It includes specific medical terms, measurements, and procedural steps.\n\nThe second note is a clinical summary, offering a concise overview of the patient's presentation, diagnosis, and treatment plan. It highlights key points such as the patient's symptoms, diagnostic results, and the decision to proceed with a single-stage surgical approach after the initial plan was unsuccessful.\n\nOverall, both notes cover the same case but serve different purposes: one as a comprehensive surgical report and the other as a clinical summary for ongoing patient management."}}
