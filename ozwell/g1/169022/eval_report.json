Both describe the medical condition of a 72-year-old male patient with bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. They detail the patient's medical history of hypertension, the findings from physical examinations, ultrasound, Doppler, and CT angiography, and the assessment of giant fusiform aneurysms in both axillary arteries. Both notes also mention the initial plan for endovascular closure, the challenges in finding appropriate-sized stents, and the decision to monitor the patient's condition closely. Additionally, both notes include communication with the patient's family about the findings and the care plan."}}
