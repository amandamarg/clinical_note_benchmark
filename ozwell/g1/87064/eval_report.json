Both notes detail the patient's long history of frequent visits to healthcare facilities, the extensive and costly investigations conducted, and the eventual diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder. They also mention the patient's referral to the Psychiatry Department and the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as part of the management plan. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more structured format with specific sections like \"Chief Complaint,\" \"History of Present Illness,\" \"Physical Examination,\" \"Investigations,\" \"Assessment,\" \"Plan,\" \"Psychiatric Evaluation,\" and \"Follow-up,\" while the case description is more narrative and detailed in explaining the patient's history and the impact on hospital resources."}}
