Both notes mention the patient's history of spinocerebellar ataxia, the discovery of the mediastinal mass in February 2017, and the subsequent medical evaluations and biopsies. They both highlight the nondiagnostic nature of initial biopsies and the eventual diagnosis of extranodal Rosai\u2013Dorfman disease. The notes also discuss the patient's symptoms, such as bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion, and the interventions performed, including pulmonary artery stenting. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, focusing on the chief complaint, history of present illness, assessment, and plan, while the case report provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey."}}
