Both notes describe the medical case of a 90-year-old diabetic woman who was admitted with sepsis and diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. They both mention the laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure, the incidental finding of a left-sided gallbladder, and the postoperative complications of diabetes aggravation and basal pneumonia. The retrospective analysis of the CT scan and the findings regarding the liver's vascular and biliary structure are also present in both notes. The second note is more organized, providing a clear breakdown of patient information, chief complaint, diagnosis, investigations, surgical findings, postoperative course, retrospective analysis, and plan."}}
