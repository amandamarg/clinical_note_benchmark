Both describe the case of a 77-year-old female with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, which had been present for about three years and had grown over time. They both mention the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), as well as the lack of relief from a stellate ganglion block. The physical examination findings, surgical procedure, and postoperative outcome are also consistent between the two notes. Both notes conclude with the diagnosis of a glomus tumor confirmed by immunostaining."}}
