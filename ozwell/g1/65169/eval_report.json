Both describe the case of a 46-year-old housewife with left knee pain and recent right hip pain. They detail her medical history, including the initial misdiagnosis of septic arthritis, the lack of significant trauma, and the ineffectiveness of antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. Both notes mention the physical examination findings, radiographic and laboratory results, and the plan for total knee replacement. They also describe the follow-up with the new complaint of right hip pain, the findings of osteolysis, and the need for further evaluation and management. The notes are consistent in their description of the patient's condition, diagnostic findings, and treatment plan."}}
