**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Left knee pain of ten months’ duration; recent right hip pain of three weeks’ duration.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient presented with left knee pain that began without any significant trauma. Initially treated for septic arthritis of the left knee, but investigations did not support this diagnosis. No history or clinical appearance suggestive of septic arthritis was noted. The patient reports a genu varus deformity of the left knee and walks with an antalgic gait, occasionally requiring a walking frame for long distances. Two trials of oral antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy were ineffective in resolving the pain.

**Physical Examination:**
- Muscular weakness in lower extremities.
- Painful movement of the left knee with a limited range of motion from 0° to 90°.
- Skin over the affected knee is normal, with no signs of infection, vascular abnormalities, or oedema.
- Peripheral pulses in the left lower limb are normal.
- Varus deformity of the left knee is passively correctable.

**Radiographic and Laboratory Findings:**
- Radiograph of the left knee showed no progressive changes in the bone defect compared to ten months prior.
- Laboratory studies, including haematological tests, revealed no evidence of metabolic, neoplastic, immunological, or infectious aetiology.

**Plan:**
- Recommended scheduling a total knee replacement for the left knee in six months.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient returned after three months with a complaint of right hip pain of three weeks’ duration. Examination revealed the right lower limb is shorter by two centimetres compared to the left. Radiograph of the right hip showed complete osteolysis of the femoral head. Laboratory studies again failed to disclose any significant findings for this occurrence. Further evaluation and management are necessary for the right hip condition.
