**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling unwell with symptoms including fever, dysuria, and abdominal pain. These symptoms began a few days ago, leading to admission to a community hospital where the patient received antibiotics and fluids. The patient is also on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation.

**Objective:**  
- **Respiratory:** The patient developed difficulty breathing three days into the hospital stay. A chest X-ray revealed lung congestion, and the patient was treated for congestive heart failure.
- **Gastrointestinal:** The patient experienced difficulty swallowing, and a swallow study confirmed oropharyngeal dysphagia.
- **Neck:** The patient developed neck pain and swelling on the right side. A CT scan showed a hemorrhage in the thyroid gland, leading to intubation.
- **Thyroid:** A biopsy of the thyroid gland was performed to rule out malignancy, revealing a nodular goiter with bleeding but no evidence of malignancy. The patient underwent surgery to remove the goiter.
- **Post-Surgery:** The patient was febrile, tachycardic, and diaphoretic with elevated T4 levels, indicating hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medications were administered to control sympathetic activity. Subsequently, the patient developed hypothyroidism and was started on thyroid supplements.

**Assessment:**  
1. Fever, dysuria, and abdominal pain - treated with antibiotics and fluids.
2. Atrial fibrillation - on warfarin therapy.
3. Congestive heart failure - treated following lung congestion.
4. Oropharyngeal dysphagia - confirmed by swallow study.
5. Hemorrhage in thyroid gland - confirmed by CT scan.
6. Nodular goiter with bleeding - confirmed by biopsy, no malignancy.
7. Post-surgical hyperthyroidism - managed with antithyroid medications.
8. Post-surgical hypothyroidism - managed with thyroid supplements.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring thyroid function and adjust thyroid supplements as needed.
- Follow up on respiratory status and manage any ongoing symptoms of heart failure.
- Monitor swallowing function and provide supportive care for dysphagia.
- Regular follow-up appointments to assess overall recovery and adjust treatment plans as necessary.

**Disposition:**  
The patient was discharged in stable condition. Further follow-up is required to monitor thyroid function and overall recovery.
