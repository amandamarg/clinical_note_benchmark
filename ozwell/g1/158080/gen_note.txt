**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:11:45 PM  

**Patient Complaint:**  
The patient presented with severe chest and back pain, which started a few days ago and has been worsening.

**Assessment:**  
A CT scan was conducted, revealing an aortic dissection, which is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta.

**Plan:**  
The patient and family initially refused an aortic repair operation. The alternative treatment option discussed is Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR). The procedure involves covering the intimal flap of the dissection with a stent graft. To acquire the proper proximal landing zone, the left subclavian artery and two-thirds of the origin of the left common carotid artery will be covered with the stent graft. 

If the left subclavian artery becomes occluded, revascularization will be considered in a staged approach if the patient develops left arm pain, claudication, or subclavian steal syndrome. The modified chimney technique will be used to preserve blood flow to the left common carotid artery.

The procedure will be performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory under general anesthesia, with a left femoral arteriotomy. A 0.035-inch wire will be placed in the ascending aorta and the left subclavian artery through the left radial artery approach to rescue blood flow to the left carotid artery if necessary. 

In the event that the aortic stent graft totally covers the left carotid artery, emergency balloon dilatation and placement of a chimney graft stent from the left subclavian artery to the aorta via this wire will be performed.

A 38Ã—150 mm SEAL aortic stent graft will be deployed to cover two-thirds of the ostium of the left common carotid artery. The left common carotid artery will be selected using a 5 Fr Judkin right catheter to complete the procedure.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
The patient expressed understanding of the procedure and trusts the medical team to proceed with the planned intervention. 

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely for any complications or symptoms indicating the need for revascularization. Further instructions and care will be provided post-procedure.
