Both describe the same medical procedure involving a 65-year-old patient with coronary artery disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for recurrent ventricular tachycardia. They both mention the use of the CARTO XP mapping system, the retrograde aortic approach, and the specifics of the ventricular tachycardia, including the cycle length, morphology, and axis of the QRS. Both notes discuss the entrainment attempt, the apparent post pacing interval, and the presence of a far field signal. They also both conclude with the successful termination of the tachycardia and the need for continued monitoring. The main difference is the format: one is a clinical note with subjective, objective, and assessment/plan sections, while the other is a more detailed procedural description."}}
