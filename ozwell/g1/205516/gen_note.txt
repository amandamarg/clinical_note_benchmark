**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 49 years
- Gender: Male
- Medical History: No previous medical history

**Chief Complaint:**
- Pain along the left side of the neck and difficulty swallowing following trauma from a foreign object at a construction site.

**Initial Evaluation:**
- No signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
- No Horner's syndrome observed.
- The point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the left side of the oropharynx.
- No complications during intubation and sedation for airway protection.

**Imaging and Findings:**
- CT angiography of the neck showed the nail was very close to the left internal carotid artery with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. No active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm was noted, although evaluation was limited by beam-hardening artifact from the nail.
- Left common carotid angiography demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail.
- 3D rotational angiography showed small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, consistent with at least a partial vessel injury.
- Intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout.

**Plan and Outcome:**
- After discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and neurointerventional teams, it was determined that the best course of action would be to monitor the injury closely.
- Despite monitoring, the patient eventually passed away due to complications from the partial vessel injury.
