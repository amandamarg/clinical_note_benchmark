Both notes mention the initial symptoms, the evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon, the findings from imaging studies, the biopsy results, and the treatment approach involving wide local excision and afterloading catheters. They also both reference the referral to St. Jude Children's Hospital and the subsequent evaluation and treatment there. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note, with the clinical note providing a more concise summary and the context information offering a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey."}}
