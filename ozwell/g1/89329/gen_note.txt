**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports a history of pain and swelling in the left knee, initially attributed to a fall a year ago. Prior to the fall, the patient was struck in the left knee by a basketball, which led to worsening pain. The patient was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon who noted a valgus posture of both lower extremities, more pronounced on the left due to external rotation, and a mild limp. The left knee exhibited hypersensitivity to light touch over the lateral aspect with soft tissue swelling below the knee, but no effusion or obvious mass was detected. 

**Objective:**  
Plain films of the knee were normal. An MRI revealed an apparent meniscal cyst in the lateral aspect of the left knee. A biopsy of the cystic structure identified a high-grade synovial cell sarcoma. A metastatic work-up, including a nuclear bone scan and CT of the chest, was negative. The local care team recommended amputation due to concerns about possible joint space contamination and uncertain functional outcomes. The patient was referred to St. Jude Children's Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Upon evaluation, there was a well-healed scar with no excessive swelling and mild tenderness on the lateral aspect of the left knee. Imaging studies showed abnormality at the site of prior surgery, equivocal for residual tumor, but no joint space abnormality. Tumor bed exploration showed no physical evidence of compromise at the joint space level.

**Assessment:**  
High-grade synovial cell sarcoma of the left knee with prior wide local excision and placement of afterloading catheters.

**Plan:**  
The patient underwent wide local excision with placement of six parallel afterloading catheters. A follow-up appointment is recommended in three months to assess progress and ensure no recurrence or complications.
