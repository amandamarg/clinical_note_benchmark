Both notes mention the patient's previous experience of acute renal failure potentially exacerbated by lithium use, and both discuss the consideration of a retrial of clozapine with careful monitoring. The main differences are in the details and structure: the first note provides a detailed account of past events and medical history, while the second note is a clinical note summarizing the current situation, assessment, and plan for the patient."}}
