**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**  
Mrs. X, a long-term patient with a 40-year history of schizophrenia, reports feeling okay today. She has been on various antipsychotics over the years. She previously experienced an adverse reaction to clozapine, specifically acute renal failure, which was thought to be exacerbated by concurrent lithium use.

**Objective:**  
- Previous adverse reaction to clozapine: acute renal failure.
- Current medication: lithium.

**Assessment:**  
Given the severe and refractory nature of Mrs. X's schizophrenia, a multidisciplinary case review concluded that a retrial of clozapine might be beneficial. The adverse effects previously observed were likely exacerbated by lithium carbonate.

**Plan:**  
- Initiate a low dose of clozapine with close monitoring for any adverse reactions.
- Regularly check lithium levels to prevent toxicity.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks.
- Patient advised to contact the office with any concerns or questions.

**Follow-up:**  
Mrs. X is scheduled to return in two weeks for a follow-up appointment. She has been instructed to monitor for any adverse reactions and to reach out if she has any concerns.
