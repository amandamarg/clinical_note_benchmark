Both notes mention the initial fracture, subsequent treatment with a splint, cast, and boot, and the recent tackle that led to persistent pain and numbness. They both detail the diagnostic imaging findings, including radiographs, CT scan, and MRI, which revealed a partial nonunion and entrapment of the neurovascular bundle. The surgical intervention and post-operative course are also covered in both notes. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information is more narrative and detailed about the surgical procedure."}}
