Both notes mention the patient's history of pacemaker implantation and replacements, the presentation of a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket, negative blood cultures, and imaging findings of an extravascular atrial lead. They also describe the treatment plan involving antibiotics, pacemaker pocket exploration, and the eventual complex lead extraction procedure. The main difference is in the level of detail, with the first note providing a more comprehensive account of the surgical procedure and post-operative course, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary."}}
