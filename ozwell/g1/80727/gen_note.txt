**Time:** 6:58 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket. The patient has a history of a dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990, with replacements in 1998 and 2003. No prior open-heart surgical procedures have been performed.

**Objective:**  
Initial presentation at the home hospital included a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and fungus. A trans-esophageal echocardiogram indicated suspicion of an extravascular atrial lead. Chest CT imaging revealed one right atrial lead tip approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was diagnosed with a suspected pacemaker pocket infection. Initial treatment included vancomycin and ceftriaxone. A pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement were performed, but extraction was not done due to increased risks associated with the extravascular lead. The infection recurred clinically, leading to the patient's transfer for complex lead extraction.

**Plan:**  
The patient underwent a combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach to minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade due to chronic right atrial lead perforation. The procedure involved a midline sternotomy in a dedicated hybrid operating theatre with cardiopulmonary bypass support available if necessary. Dense adhesions were found within the pericardial space, likely due to prior pericarditis, and care was taken to leave the right atrial dissection.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be monitored for any further complications or recurrence of infection. The patient was advised to reach out with any questions or concerns in the future.
