**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:20:18 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports not feeling well and presents with complaints of a persistent orocutaneous fistula. The patient has a medical history of a plasmacytoma removal from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago. The patient was referred to our clinic for this issue.

**Objective:**  
CT images demonstrate a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous operations have been unsuccessful in closing the fistula.

**Assessment:**  
The main reason for the unsuccessful closure of the fistula is believed to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula.

**Plan:**  
We have decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. The steps include:

1. Excising the fistula and preparing the healthy soft tissues.
2. Extending the incision at the extraoral site to the posterior and anterior directions, following previous incision lines.
3. Dissecting the superficial layer of the neck fascia in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible.
4. Exposing the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible, and dissecting the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland.
5. Mobilizing the gland while protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct.
6. Releasing the margins of the wound at the oral site by blunt dissection and closing with mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene.
7. Preparing a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and the defect area.
8. Rotating the submandibular gland through the soft tissue tunnel while preserving the pedicle.
9. Suturing the rotated gland to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization.
10. Closing the flap at the cutaneous site.

The patient has been informed about the complexity of the procedure and understands the plan. Follow-up care instructions will be provided post-procedure.
