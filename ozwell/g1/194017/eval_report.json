Both describe the same medical case involving a 56-year-old male patient with a persistent orocutaneous fistula following the removal of a plasmacytoma from the medial side of the left mandible. They both outline the patient's past medical history, the unsuccessful attempts to close the fistula, and the decision to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to address the issue. The surgical plan and steps are also detailed in both notes, including the excision of the fistula, preparation of soft tissues, mobilization of the submandibular gland, and closure techniques. The main difference is the format and structure, with the first note being a narrative description and the second note being a structured clinical note with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
