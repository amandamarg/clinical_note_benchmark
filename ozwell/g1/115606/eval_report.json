They both describe the case of a 60-year-old woman with pain in the medial aspect of the right knee, which is non-radiating and relieved by rest but exacerbated by squatting and sitting cross-legged. Both notes mention the patient's difficulty in climbing stairs, a past patella fracture treated with open reduction and internal fixation, and subsequent implant removal. They also describe the physical examination findings, including tenderness and a full range of motion at the knee joint, and the presence of broken circlage wire pieces around the knee joint as seen on x-rays. Both notes conclude with a provisional diagnosis of osteoarthritis, a recommendation for total knee replacement and removal of broken hardware, and the patient's refusal of surgery. The follow-up plan is also similar, advising the patient to monitor for changes in symptoms."}}
