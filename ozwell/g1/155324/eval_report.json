Both describe the medical history and recent events concerning an 80-year-old woman, Mrs. Y, who was admitted to the emergency room after a collapse and cardiac arrest. They detail her medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a total thyroidectomy. Both notes describe her treatment in the ICU, including pneumonia, respiratory distress, and an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They also mention the development of an Acinetobacter infection and bilateral pleural effusion, which made her unweanable from the ventilator. \n\nThe notes discuss the decision to perform a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) due to her condition and the complications arising from her altered anatomy post-thyroidectomy. They describe the detection of a pulse at the midline of the trachea, the use of ultrasound guidance to confirm the presence of an artery, and the subsequent abandonment of the procedure due to the difficulty in identifying landmarks. Both notes conclude with a plan for close monitoring and further tests as necessary."}}
