**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Y  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Collapse at home, cardiac arrest, and subsequent admission to the emergency room.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mrs. Y was admitted to the emergency room following a collapse at home, where she experienced a cardiac arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and intubated. During her stay in the ICU, she developed pneumonia, was treated, and extubated. However, she experienced another episode of respiratory distress, necessitating re-intubation. She was then transferred to our hospital. During her admission here, she had an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was treated endoscopically. She also developed an Acinetobacter infection in the sputum and bilateral pleural effusion, rendering her unweanable from the ventilator.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Diabetes  
- Hypertension  
- Atrial fibrillation  
- Total thyroidectomy  

**Procedural Note:**  
Due to the patient's condition, a decision was made to perform a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) electively to facilitate weaning from the ventilator or as a therapeutic measure, given the uncertainty of the duration of ventilator support. The patient's past history of thyroidectomy suggested an altered anatomy, potentially complicating landmark identification during PDT. The patient was positioned, prepared, and draped for the procedure. Upon palpation, a pulse was detected at the midline of the trachea at the level of the third and fourth tracheal rings, which is unusual. The pulse was rhythmic with the monitor, confirming the presence of an artery. The artery was traced superiorly and inferiorly, revealing it became lateral to the trachea on the right side. Ultrasound guidance with a high-frequency linear probe confirmed this distortion. The sonoanotomy showed the right common carotid artery ascending very close to the trachea, forming a loop anterior to the trachea at the level of the third and fourth rings, and then ascending laterally before dividing into the external and internal carotid arteries. No other vascular abnormalities were noted on either side. Due to the difficulty in identifying landmarks, the procedure was abandoned.

**Plan:**  
- Close monitoring of the patient's condition.  
- Further tests as necessary.  
- Follow-up instructions to be provided.
