They both describe the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of smoking, presenting with difficulty swallowing and a painful lesion on his tongue. Both notes detail the examination findings, including the size and location of the tongue lesion, and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy. They mention the initial biopsy results, the differential diagnosis, and the subsequent discovery of a mass in the left kidney suggestive of RCC. Both notes outline the plan for debulking surgery of the tongue lesion, followed by radiotherapy, and the eventual radical nephrectomy. The follow-up and discussion sections also align closely, indicating that the patient understands the treatment plan."}}
