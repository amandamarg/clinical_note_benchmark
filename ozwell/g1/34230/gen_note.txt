**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Department:** Nephrology  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They were referred to our Nephrology Department in 2009 following a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) after a spontaneous miscarriage during the second trimester of pregnancy. The patient experienced significant proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, leading to a kidney biopsy that revealed crescentic focal segmental glomerulonephritis, a type of lupus nephritis.

**Objective:**  
Initial treatment included cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and azathioprine, which were not effective. The treatment was changed to mycophenolic acid with rituximab. Despite the absence of extra-renal manifestations of lupus, the patient's kidney function deteriorated, reaching end-stage kidney disease approximately four years after starting immunosuppression. The patient began peritoneal dialysis with hydroxychloroquine and low-dose methylprednisolone.

Following the induction of peritoneal dialysis, the patient experienced fever, with all infectious causes investigated but no definitive diagnosis reached. Empiric antibiotic treatment led to full recovery. Over the next 12 months, the patient had three more hospitalizations due to fever, with inconclusive workups except for the last admission, which revealed a high CMV viral load.

The patient was given five pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin due to low immunoglobulin levels (low IgA, IgG, and IgE, with slightly elevated IgM). Monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated to manage acquired immunodeficiency. The patient reports 2 to 3 episodes of upper respiratory infections and acute tonsillitis each year.

In June 2020, the patient received a cadaveric kidney transplant with two shared HLA class compatibilities. The patient reports doing well post-transplant.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring kidney function and overall health post-transplant.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to assess progress and address any concerns.
- Continue monthly intravenous immunoglobulin administration to manage acquired immunodeficiency.
- Monitor for any signs of infection or complications.

**Follow-up:**  
A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks to monitor the patient's progress.
