**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 17-year-old male
- BMI: 37 (Overweight)

**Chief Complaint:**
- Severe back pain

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports severe back pain located in the thoracolumbar junction, affecting daily activities. The pain does not radiate to the legs, and there are no neurological symptoms. The patient has been followed but not treated in another spinal unit since age 16. The kyphosis has gradually progressed and become symptomatic.

**Medical History:**
- No history of spinal infections, injuries, skeletal dysplasias, or medical co-morbidities.

**Physical Examination:**
- Sharply angular kyphosis of 105째 with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction.
- Bilateral hamstring tightness.
- Normal neurological examination.
- Associated thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30째.
- No evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis.

**Imaging:**
- Lateral radiograph: Bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis.
- MRI (at age 16): Spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction, no cord signal change, no disc herniation, no intraspinal anomalies, no evidence of bridging osteophytes, no fusion of posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, and no congenital vertebral abnormalities.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with severe back pain refractory to conservative measures and activity modification, extreme degree of deformity, and risk for further progression potentially causing neurological complications.

**Plan:**
The patient underwent kyphosis correction surgery at 17 years and 11 months old. Pre-surgery deformity measured 115째, corrected to 100째 on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster post-surgery. The surgery involved a combined single approach.

**Follow-Up:**
A follow-up appointment is scheduled in a few weeks. The patient is advised to return if any symptoms or problems arise.
