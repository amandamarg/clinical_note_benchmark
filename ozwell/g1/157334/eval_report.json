They both describe the case of a 53-year-old man who presented with a sudden onset of headache and mental deterioration, leading to a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) with hydrocephalus. Both notes mention the patient's drowsiness, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, and the absence of focal neurologic signs. They also detail the patient's medical and family history, diagnostic imaging findings, interventions attempted, and the post-intervention course, including the development of mental deterioration and left hemiplegia. The current status and plan for follow-up are also consistent between the two notes."}}
