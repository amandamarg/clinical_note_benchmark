They both describe the case of a 60-year-old female laborer diagnosed with carcinoma lung with metastasis, presenting with dyspnea. Both notes detail the patient's history of pleural effusion and previous pleural aspirations followed by thoracocentesis. They describe the refusal of thoracoscopy and talc poudrage by the patient and the subsequent plan to insert an indwelling intercostal tube using a newer economical technique. The procedure, including the use of an 18 Fr rhemsons ICD tube and the creation of a subcutaneous tunnel, is outlined in both notes. The outcome and follow-up instructions are also consistent across both notes."}}
