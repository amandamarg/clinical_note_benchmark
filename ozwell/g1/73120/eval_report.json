They both describe the case of an 11-year-old male who was referred to the emergency department due to slight periodontal bleeding. Both notes detail the diagnostic process, including the orthopantomography, CT scan, selective arteriography, and MRI, which revealed a large high-flow intraosseous arteriovenous malformation. They also describe the treatment plan involving an endovascular approach with embolization, the patient's hospital course, and follow-up results showing no recurrence of symptoms. The main difference is in the formatting and slight variations in wording, but the content and sequence of events are consistent across both notes."}}
