Both notes mention her past medical history, including a previous pregnancy resulting in a missed abortion, depression, bilateral MCA stroke, and the replacement of her mitral valve with a St. Jude mechanical valve. They also detail her anticoagulation therapy, switching from warfarin to Lovenox during pregnancy, and the complications she faced, such as a stroke and a missed abortion. The notes emphasize the management plan for her high-risk pregnancy and the need for close monitoring. Overall, the notes are very similar, providing consistent information about the patient's medical history, recent events, and ongoing care plan."}}
