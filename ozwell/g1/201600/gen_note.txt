**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:30 PM  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a complaint of a crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in the right eye. The symptoms were acute in onset with no prior history of similar symptoms. The patient has a history of working in a cocoa farm plantation during childhood and reported being bitten by unknown flies during those years. The patient denied any systemic symptoms, swelling, or itching elsewhere in the body.

**Objective:**  
- Visual acuity: 6/6 in both eyes.  
- Ocular examination revealed an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye.  
- The patient reported a crawling sensation during the examination and again after adopting a face-down position.

**Assessment:**  
The presence of an actively mobile worm in the subconjunctival space, along with the patient's history of exposure to fly bites in a cocoa farm plantation, is suggestive of Loa loa infestation.

**Plan:**  
The patient was taken to the operating room where the worm was successfully extracted using local infiltration of the conjunctiva with lignocaine anesthesia. Histological examination confirmed the worm to be an adult Loa loa.

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family was informed about the findings and the successful extraction of the worm. They were advised on the nature of the Loa loa worm and the importance of follow-up care.
