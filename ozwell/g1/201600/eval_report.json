Both cases involve a history of exposure to environments where they could have been bitten by flies, leading to the infestation. The visual acuity in both cases is normal, and the presence of a worm in the subconjunctival space is noted. In both cases, the worm is extracted successfully, and histological examination confirms it to be an adult Loa loa worm. The main differences are the duration of symptoms, the presence of a cyst wall in the second case, and the fact that the second patient had a reaction to diethyl carbamazepine."}}
