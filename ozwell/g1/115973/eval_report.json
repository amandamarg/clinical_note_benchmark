Both notes mention the patient's history of shunt revisions, recent surgeries, and ongoing issues with headaches and vision problems. They also describe the patient's recent presentation with an object protruding from the rectum, which was identified as the distal peritoneal catheter. The notes cover the patient's past medical and surgical history, the recent shunt revision surgeries, and the postoperative course, including the decrease in headaches and the lasting visual acuity deficit. Overall, the notes provide a consistent account of the patient's medical situation and recent developments."}}
