Both notes mention his initial presentation with gross hematuria, the discovery of a bladder tumor, and the subsequent transurethral resection of the tumor. They also detail the postoperative treatment with intravesical mitomycin C, the pathology findings, and the persistent urinary symptoms he experiences. Both notes highlight the findings from various cystoscopies and urine cytologies, which consistently show high-grade cancer. The main difference is that the clinical note from 10/1/2025 includes a plan to refer Mr. R.F. to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment options."}}
