Both notes mention the initial breast implantation, the revisions, the symptoms noticed in 2014, the MRI findings in 2016, the surgical interventions including capsulectomy and explantation, and the pathology results showing SCC. However, the first note provides a more detailed timeline and additional information about the patient's disease progression, treatments, and eventual outcome, while the second note is a more concise summary focusing on key events and findings."}}
