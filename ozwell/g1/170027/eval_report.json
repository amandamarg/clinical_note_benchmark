Both notes detail the patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and erythematous changes in the left leg, the limited motion and sensory reduction due to a previous sciatic nerve injury, and the development of a fluid-filled mass with a draining sinus. They also describe the radiographic findings of a radiopaque mass and the angiographic findings of popliteal artery obstruction. The clinical course and outcome, including the patient's deterioration and passing, are also consistent between the two notes."}}
