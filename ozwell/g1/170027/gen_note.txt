**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and previous injuries to the left leg, including a tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago with open reduction and internal fixation, and a sciatic nerve injury. Eight years later, the patient sustained a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture, which were treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and stent insertion in the femoral artery.

**Presenting Complaint:**
- The patient presented with pain and swelling in the left leg, which started a month ago without any specific trauma. Erythematous changes were noted on the anterolateral aspect of the left leg.

**Physical Examination and Findings:**
- The patient had limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in the foot due to the previous sciatic nerve injury.
- Ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, and ankle plantar flexion was 5 degrees. All toes exhibited clawing deformity.
- Motor strength of the ankle: dorsiflexion grade 0, plantar flexion grade 3.
- Sensation: No sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, with sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.

**Radiographic and Angiographic Findings:**
- Radiographs showed a widespread radiopaque mass on the left leg. A mass had developed over time, as seen in radiographs taken 10 years ago.
- Angiography revealed an obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation.

**Clinical Course:**
- After admission, the patient was maintained with a long leg splint. Two weeks post-admission, erythematous changes localized to the anterior aspect in the middle of the leg, forming a fluid-filled, erythematous mass. A draining sinus developed spontaneously, discharging a thick fluid with a chalk-like material through the shiny skin via the sinus.

**Outcome:**
- Unfortunately, the patient's condition deteriorated, and the patient passed away.
