Both notes describe the same clinical scenario involving a 12-year-old boy with a dentigerous cyst requiring excision and a history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. They include details about the patient's physical examination, laboratory investigations, cardiovascular findings, and the plan for procedural sedation.
