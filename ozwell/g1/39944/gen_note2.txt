**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Date:** 10/8/2025
- **Reason for Visit:** Post-transplantation check-up

**Medical History:**
- **Transplantation:** Orthotopic renal transplantation using a kidney from HLA semi-identical sister.
- **Reason for Transplantation:** End-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis.
- **Lupus History:** Bilateral thrombosis of both common and external iliac arteries due to lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies, requiring bilateral percutaneous angioplasty with wall stenting.
- **Additional Findings:** Thrombosis of both iliac veins and lower portion of the inferior vena cava; extensive atherosclerotic lesions of the abdominal aorta.
- **Cardiac History:** Mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude prosthetic valve; anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarol.

**Donor Information:**
- **Donor:** Sister, HLA semi-identical.
- **Donor Workup:** Slightly lower tubular mass of the right kidney chosen for procurement.

**Surgical Details:**
- **Contraindications:** “Classic” extraperitoneal pelvic transplantation contraindicated due to stented iliac arteries and extended atheromatosis of the aorta.
- **Surgical Technique:** Alternative technique with transplantation of the graft into the location of a native kidney.
- **CT-Angiography Findings:** Left renal artery appropriate for anastomosis with graft artery; anatomical variant of left recipient renal vein with low implantation to inferior vena cava.
- **Procurement:** Laparoscopic right donor transperitoneal nephrectomy using linear stapler Endo-GIA.
- **Ischemic Times:** Warm ischemic time of 3 minutes.
- **Preservation:** Graft cold flushed with HTK solution and preserved on ice during left nephrectomy of the recipient.
- **Procedure Duration:** Total donor nephrectomy duration was 95 minutes.
- **Blood Loss:** Total blood loss due to the procedure was 25 mL.

**Plan:**
- Review test results and follow up with the patient regarding post-transplantation status and any necessary adjustments to treatment or care plan.
