They both describe the same patient's case, including her symptoms of anxiety, paranoia, visual hallucinations, and psychosis. They detail her medical history of recurrent submandibular and submental abscesses, her allergies to certain antibiotics, and her recent treatment with levofloxacin and metronidazole. Both notes mention the discontinuation of these antibiotics due to concerns they may have caused her psychiatric symptoms, and her transition to ceftriaxone. They also highlight the lack of personal or family history of psychiatric illness, the negative results from drug and toxin screens, and the absence of intracranial pathologies or metabolic causes for her altered mental status. The notes conclude with a plan to monitor her symptoms and conduct additional testing."}}
