Both describe the medical history and current condition of a 78-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and recent detection of cardiac tumors. They both mention the initial diagnosis of right breast cancer in 2003, the treatment history including mastectomy and chemotherapy, and the recurrences in 2007 and 2013. Both notes detail the recent detection of multiple cardiac tumors via echocardiography, the absence of symptoms prior to detection, and the lack of family history of cardiac myxoma. They also describe the diagnostic findings, including the echocardiography and coronary angiography results, and the pathological identification of the tumors as myxomas. The treatment plan involving surgical resection due to the risk of embolism or obstruction is also consistent in both notes."}}
