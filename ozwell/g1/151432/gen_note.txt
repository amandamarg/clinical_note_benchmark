**Patient Information:**  
- **Initial Diagnosis:** Right breast cancer in 2003  
- **Treatment History:** Total mastectomy and lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy  
- **Recurrence History:** First recurrence in 2007, second recurrence in 2013  

**Recent Medical History:**  
- **2013 CT Scan Results:** Revealed a right-sided pleural effusion and a mass shadow in the sternum  
- **Current Condition:** Multiple cardiac tumors detected on echocardiography  

**Symptoms:**  
- Asymptomatic prior to detection of cardiac tumors  

**Family History:**  
- No family history of cardiac myxoma  

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Echocardiography:** 4 tumors in the left atrium and left ventricle  
- **Coronary Angiography:** Feeding arteries from the left circumflex coronary artery to the tumors, no obstructive coronary lesion  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Pathological examination identified all 4 tumors as myxomas  

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Surgical resection recommended due to the risk of embolism or obstruction from mobile tumors located in the left semilunar cusp of the aortic valve and anterior mitral leaflet  

**Next Steps:**  
- Surgery to be scheduled as soon as possible  
- Patient advised to continue medication and follow oncologist's instructions  

**Physician's Notes:**  
The patient was referred for further examination of multiple cardiac tumors. Given the risk associated with the identified myxomas, surgical intervention is deemed necessary to prevent potential complications.
