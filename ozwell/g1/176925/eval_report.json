Both notes mention the initial diagnosis, the patient's symptoms, the surgical procedure performed, and the findings from the surgery and biopsy. They also discuss the patient's postoperative recovery and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more structured format with sections for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan, while the context information is more narrative in style."}}
