They both mention the patient's initial presentation with a large mass in the right breast, the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant neoplasm with features of carcinoma and carcinosarcoma, and the patient's decision to initially forgo treatment. Both notes detail the surgical intervention of a right radical mastectomy and the subsequent development of chronic lymphedema. The notes also align in terms of the patient's past medical history, physical examination findings, and the treatment plan involving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more concise summary, while the context information includes more detailed pathology and treatment specifics."}}
