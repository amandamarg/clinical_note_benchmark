Both notes mention the patient's symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, the vital signs, and the results of the physical examination, including the S4 heart sound and cannon A waves. They also detail the diagnostic tests performed, such as the 12-lead electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography, and the assessment of age-related degenerative conduction disease. The plan to implant a permanent pacemaker is also consistent in both notes, along with the mention of potential challenges due to the patient's venous anomaly. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed account of the pacemaker implantation procedure and the specific venous anomalies encountered, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary."}}
