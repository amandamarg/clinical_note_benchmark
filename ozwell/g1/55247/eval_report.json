Both describe the case of a 17-year-old Malay girl who was involved in a road traffic accident, resulting in a severe right thigh pain due to a femur fracture. They both mention the history of a previous road traffic accident two years prior, which was treated with intramedullary nailing. The physical examination findings, radiographic findings, and the surgical procedure details are consistent across both notes. The surgical techniques attempted and the post-operative care are also described similarly. The main difference is the format and some minor details in wording, but the core information remains the same."}}
