They both describe the case of a 23-year-old man with a history of blunt trauma to his right hand and forearm, resulting in swelling and abrasions. Both notes mention that there were no fractures seen on radiographs and no surgery or sutures were needed. They also detail the patient's diagnosis of Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) without objective imaging confirmation and the various treatments he received, including a cervical epidural block, stellate ganglion block, intravenous block, and dorsal column stimulator implantation. Both notes describe the patient's current symptoms, including constant pain, inability to use the right hand and arm, and the specific posture of the right hand, elbow, and wrist. Additionally, both notes mention the patient's involvement in a workers\u2019 compensation litigation process and the need for further review to develop a follow-up plan."}}
