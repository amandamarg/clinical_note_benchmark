They both mention the discovery of the lesion through imaging, the asymptomatic nature of the patient, and the normal physical examination. Both notes outline the plan for further evaluation, including endocrinological assessment and potential surgical intervention. However, the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure and histological findings, while the second note focuses more on the initial assessment and plan for further evaluation."}}
