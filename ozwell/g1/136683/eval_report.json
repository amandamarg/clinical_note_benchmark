They both mention the patient's chronic abdominal pain and foreign body sensation following an incisional hernia repair with mesh in 2010, the development of an incisional hernia after a right hemicolectomy, and the subsequent surgical intervention to address the chronic hematoma and scar tissue. Both notes detail the findings from the imaging studies, the surgical procedure performed, and the postoperative outcomes. The main difference is in the level of detail and the format, with the clinical note being more structured and concise."}}
