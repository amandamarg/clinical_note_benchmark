**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a complaint of a crawling sensation and foreign body sensation in the right eye. The symptoms were acute in onset with no prior ocular symptoms. The patient has a history of working in a cocoa farm plantation during childhood and reported suffering from bites from unknown flies during those years. The patient denied any systemic symptoms, swelling, or itching elsewhere in the body. Visual acuity was reported as 6/6 in both eyes.

**Objective:**  
Ocular examination revealed the presence of an actively mobile worm in the nasal subconjunctival space of the right eye. The patient reported a crawling sensation during the examination. Upon adopting a face-down position, the patient again experienced the crawling sensation in the same eye.

**Assessment:**  
The findings are consistent with an ocular infestation by an adult Loa loa worm.

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family was informed about the findings and the successful extraction of the worm. They were advised on the nature of the Loa loa worm and the outcome of the procedure. 

**Follow-Up:**
