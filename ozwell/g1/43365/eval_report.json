They both describe the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with shortness of breath and a swollen right arm, following a severe upper respiratory tract infection. Both notes detail the findings of a deep vein thrombosis in the right subclavian vein, a pulmonary embolus, and a mixed echogenicity mass in the left adnexal region. They also mention the elevated CA-125 level, the management plan involving anticoagulation and a prophylactic inferior vena cava filter, and the surgical intervention of a laparotomy to remove an ovarian mass. The differential diagnoses listed are the same, and both notes indicate awaiting biopsy results for further management. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed pathological findings and the final diagnosis of Meigs syndrome, while the second note is a clinical summary without these details."}}
