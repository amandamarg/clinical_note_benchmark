**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  
**Department:** Emergency Department  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Referred to the emergency department following an injury to the right femoral artery during orchiopexy for right undescended testis.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient underwent an orchiopexy for a right undescended testis at another facility. During the procedure, the surgeon inadvertently injured the right femoral artery using electrocautery. The artery was repaired, but a good distal pulse could not be palpated, leading to the patient's referral to our hospital approximately 12 hours post-injury. A peripheral computed tomography angiography with aortography performed at the primary institute showed an abrupt cutoff of the right femoral artery near the origin of the profunda femoris artery. Upon presentation, the patient had no distal pulses in the right lower limb, and the limb appeared pale and cold.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Right lower limb: Pale and cold with absent distal pulses.
- Sutured wound on the right upper thigh: Extends from the pubic bone medially, laterally along the skin crease between the thigh and abdomen, up to a point about 5 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Doppler study of the lower limbs: Revealed a thrombus extending from the femoral artery up to the external iliac artery above the inguinal ligament proximally.

**Surgical Findings:**  
During reexploration, it was noted that the orchiopexy was not completed by the previous surgeon. The testis was found lying in the superficial inguinal pouch at the superior flap of the wound. The middle of the wound revealed the sutured, contracted femoral artery. A longitudinal extension of the incision was made along the long axis of the limb for better exposure of the femoral artery, and systemic heparinization was performed.

**Plan:**  
The patient was advised to rest and follow the instructions provided for follow-up care. Further details of the medical history and test results will be discussed with the patient.

**Outcome:**  
Despite efforts, the patient unfortunately passed away. The family has been informed and offered condolences.
