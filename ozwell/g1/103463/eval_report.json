Both notes detail the sequence of events, including the initial surgery, the injury to the femoral artery, the subsequent referral to a tertiary hospital, and the findings upon examination and reexploration. They also describe the diagnostic studies performed, the surgical findings, and the treatment plan. However, there is a significant difference in the outcome: the first note describes a successful recovery, while the second note states that the patient unfortunately passed away."}}
