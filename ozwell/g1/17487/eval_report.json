They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 30-year-old woman from Assam, India, who experienced mild pain and swelling in her right forearm due to a soft tissue sarcoma. Both notes detail her initial treatment at a local hospital, subsequent surgery in Guwahati, and further treatment at another institute due to recurring pain. They describe the surgical procedure involving the excision of the brachial artery and the use of a great saphenous vein graft. The follow-up care and monitoring plan are also consistent in both notes."}}
