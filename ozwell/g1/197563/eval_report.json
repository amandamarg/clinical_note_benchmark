Both notes mention the patient's previous bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, the identification of the dislodged appliance, and the subsequent symptoms and examination findings. They also discuss the plan for further tests and potential removal of the appliance. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the clinical situation, including the surgical exploration and removal of the appliance, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary with a focus on the patient's history, examination, and plan."}}
