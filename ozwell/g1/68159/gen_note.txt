**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:08:31 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient has a 2-year history of recurrent hospitalizations for various neurologic and cardiologic emergencies. The patient was admitted to the hospital with left hemiparesis, which gradually progressed to quadriparesis, bilateral hemianopsia, intracranial hypertension syndrome, and seizures. The diagnosis of echinococcosis was made based on radiologic findings of multiple cerebral hydatid cysts and a sizable cyst of the heart.

**Treatment History:**  
The hydatid cyst of the heart was treated first with a thoracotomy. The patient underwent three consecutive surgical operations for the removal of six cerebral cysts. The patient was on albendazole treatment throughout the hospitalization, which led to the shrinkage and disappearance of two other cerebral cysts.

**Surgical Procedures:**  
- **First Procedure:** Two frontal hydatid cysts were completely removed via a right frontal craniotomy, and another cyst of the occipital lobe was removed via a separate right occipital craniotomy. The postoperative recovery was initially uneventful.
- **Postoperative Event:** Two weeks later, the patient presented with generalized seizures (with loss of consciousness and urinary incontinence). An emergent cerebral CT scan revealed a marked expansion of the left occipital lobe cyst, cerebral edema, and midline shift. The possible explanation was the disturbance of pressure balance between the lesions after the removal of the contralateral cyst.
- **Second Procedure:** A left occipital craniotomy was performed for the complete removal of the left occipital cyst. There were no postoperative events.
- **Third Procedure:** Ten days later, a right cerebellar hemisphere cyst was removed via a right suboccipital craniectomy, and a left frontal lobe cyst was removed via a left frontal craniotomy.

**Current Status:**  
The patient's focal neurologic signs eventually disappeared, with the exception of a slight unilateral hemianopsia. Ten years after discharge, the patient remains in good condition, with no signs of clinical or radiologic relapse.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 months.
