They both describe the same patient's case, detailing the severe facial trauma she experienced after falling off a cliff while mountain biking. Both notes mention the initial poor general condition, the specific injuries sustained, the surgical interventions performed, and the subsequent prosthetic treatment. They also highlight the patient's refusal of bone graft surgery and the eventual use of a zirconia-based crown bridge prosthesis. The clinical examination findings and the recommendation for follow-up with a prosthetic specialist are consistent in both notes."}}
