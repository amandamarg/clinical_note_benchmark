**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Reason for Visit:**  
The patient was referred for dental rehabilitation following esthetic surgery operations.

**Medical History:**  
The patient experienced severe facial trauma after falling off a cliff while mountain biking. Initial evaluation in the Emergency Service indicated a poor general condition with a hemoglobin value of 6 mg/dL, severe maxillofacial trauma, and bleeding. The patient underwent rapid hemodynamic stabilization and CT scans, followed by an emergency consultation at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

**Injury Details:**  
The patient sustained severe soft tissue injury and comminuted bone fractures on the bilateral maxilla, zygoma, periorbital area, mandible, and nasal bones. The bone fragments were fixed with titanium plates and screws without bone grafting. Additionally, there was a posterior vertical split fracture on the hard palate extending anteriorly to both sides, creating a mobile free bone fragment on the anterior maxilla. These fractures were fixed after reconstruction, followed by soft tissue repair.

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient reported no complications in the early postoperative period. However, follow-up indicated bone necrosis on the anterior maxilla, including the alveolar process extending to the palate. After debridement of the necrosis process, the defect was reconstructed with mucosal flaps, and bony reconstruction was postponed. The patient refused the planned bone graft surgery for the repair of the defect on the anterior maxilla, leading to a consultation for prosthetic treatment.

**Clinical Examination:**  
The examination revealed soft tissue defects on the face, particularly in the eye area, and a dysmorphic appearance. The panoramic radiograph demonstrated the mini plates and screws used for fixing the fractured zygomatic arch, orbital, and maxillary sinus walls. Intraoral examination revealed the absence of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge and bone until the apex line. The maxillary central and lateral incisors and right canine teeth were lost due to the traumatic injury. Prior to the accident, the patient had an Angle Class I occlusion with an acceptable vertical and horizontal overlap.

**Recommendation:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with a specialist in prosthetic treatment for further management.
