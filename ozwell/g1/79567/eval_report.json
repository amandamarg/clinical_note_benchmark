They both describe the medical history and recent clinical events of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman with a rapidly enlarging nodule on her left cheek. Both notes mention her history of diabetes, hypertension, kidney transplant, and previous squamous cell carcinoma. They detail the physical examination findings, diagnostic studies, procedures performed, and the pathology report. The notes also discuss the recurrence of the nodule, the subsequent surgeries, and the eventual diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma with metastases. The plan for follow-up and patient instructions are also consistent between the two notes."}}
