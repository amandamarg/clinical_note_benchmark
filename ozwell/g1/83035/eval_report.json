They both describe the case of an 80-year-old man who was admitted to the Emergency Department with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a cutaneous lesion with purulent discharge. Both notes mention the patient's past medical history of a liver abscess operation 15 years ago and the absence of other chronic illnesses. The physical examination findings, diagnostic studies, treatment, and hospital course are also consistent between the two notes. Both notes detail the surgical drainage procedure, the postoperative complications, and the culture results showing Klebsiella pneumonia. The treatment plan involving a 14-day course of ampicillin-sulbactam and the follow-up recommendations are also the same. Overall, the content and details in both notes align closely."}}
