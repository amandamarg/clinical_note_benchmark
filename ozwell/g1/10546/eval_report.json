They both describe the case of a 79-year-old male with a left leg ulcer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dementia. Both notes mention the patient's malnourished state, significant lower limb oedema, and a Mini Mental State Examination score of 12/30. They describe the circumferential ulceration of the left lower leg, the presence of tenacious slough, and larval infestation. Both notes also detail the management plan, including wound dressing, antibiotics, elevation, compression, and eventual grafting. The discovery of an elastic band as the cause of the ulcer is also noted in both. The main difference is that the first note provides a narrative of the patient's journey through the healthcare system, while the second note is a structured clinical note summarizing the case."}}
