They both describe the case of a 24-year-old Saudi male who was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for repeated infection and pain in the right side of the lower jaw. Both notes mention the presence of a hard bone-like structure distal to the right lower second molar, poor oral hygiene, and a foul odor. They also describe the radiographic findings of a calcified mass and the treatment plan involving the surgical removal of the calcified mass and disimpaction of the lower right third molar. The postoperative course and histopathological examination results are also consistent between the two notes. The main difference is in the level of detail and the format of the notes, with the clinical note being more structured and concise."}}
