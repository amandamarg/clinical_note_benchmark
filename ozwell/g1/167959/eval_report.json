Both notes mention the initial conservative approach with composite fillings for the upper front teeth and the need for implant restoration in the posterior superior quadrants. They also describe the patient's return in 2017 with pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine, leading to the decision to replace the residual teeth with an implant-supported bridge. The treatment process involving the extraction of lateral incisors, placement of immediate implants, and use of temporary bridges is detailed in both notes. The outcome of the patient passing away is also mentioned in both notes."}}
