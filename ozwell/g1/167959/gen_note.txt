**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:30:48 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Fractured central incisors, high risk for caries, eccentric bruxism, partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant, multiple decay and fractured teeth.

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with fractured central incisors but reported no pain or discomfort besides the fracture. The patient acknowledged experiencing teeth grinding at night.

**Objective:**  
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism noted.  
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.  
- Multiple decay and fractured teeth observed.  

**Assessment:**  
The fractured teeth are likely contributed to by the patient's bruxism. The conservative approach will be taken to maintain the upper front teeth using composite fillings. Restoration of the posterior superior quadrants with implants is necessary.

**Plan:**  
- Composite fillings for the upper front teeth.  
- Implant restoration for the posterior superior quadrants.  

**Follow-up:**  
Three years later, in 2017, the patient returned with pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. Due to the poor conservative prognosis from the subgingival depth and extent of decay, the patient opted for an implant-supported bridge to replace the residual teeth, similar to the posterior prostheses.

**Treatment:**  
- Lateral incisors extracted and two immediate implants placed.  
- Four residual teeth prepared as abutments for a temporary bridge to maintain aesthetics and function during osseointegration.  
- Remaining four teeth extracted using SST, and the initial provisional bridge replaced by a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.  
- Only one out of the four abutment teeth required root canal treatment due to a periapical infection.

**Outcome:**  
The patient eventually passed away. Further assistance to the family is offered during this time.
