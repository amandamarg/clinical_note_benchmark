Both describe the case of a 35-year-old female endurance athlete with a history of chronic left hip and groin pain, which led to the discovery of iliac vein compression and deep vein thrombosis. They detail the patient's medical history, diagnostic studies, and treatment, including anticoagulation therapy and the placement of a stent. Both notes mention the patient's heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation and the successful outcome of the treatment, allowing her to continue training without complications. The main difference is the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and medical details are consistent."}}
