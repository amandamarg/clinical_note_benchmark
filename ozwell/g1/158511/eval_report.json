Both notes detail the traumatic near total amputation of the right distal tibia, the procedures performed, and the patient's condition. They mention the application of an external fixator, internal fixation for the fibula, wound exploration, and the use of a vein graft for arterial reconstruction. The notes also highlight the patient's stable general condition despite the severity of the injury and the plan for recovery, including physical therapy and follow-up appointments. Overall, the notes are very similar, providing consistent information about the patient's injury, treatment, and recovery plan."}}
