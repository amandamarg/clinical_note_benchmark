Both notes mention the presence of a large sacral mass, the patient's inability to ambulate, and the impact on the patient's quality of life. They also include details about the patient's family and social history, as well as the physical examination findings. However, the first note provides a more detailed account of the patient's medical journey, including the diagnosis of sacral chordoma, the multidisciplinary team discussion, the surgical procedure, and the post-operative complications and rehabilitation. The second note is a clinical summary that focuses on the chief complaint, history of present illness, and the plan for referral to the Orthopaedic Oncology department."}}
