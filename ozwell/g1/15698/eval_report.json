Both describe the same patient's medical history, including the traumatic T5 paralysis, the surgical procedures performed, and the implantation of electrodes and batteries for electrical stimulation. They both mention the use of a baclofen pump for spasticity and the classification of the spinal cord injury as grade A according to the American Spinal Injury Association grading. The details of the procedure, including the number of leads and electrodes, the configuration of the batteries, and the surgical approach, are consistent in both notes. Additionally, both notes emphasize the patient's ability to perform certain movements with the help of electrical stimulation and the plan for follow-up appointments."}}
