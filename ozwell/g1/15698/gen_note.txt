**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [Patient's MRN]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports a history of complete paralysis at the T5 level for the past 2 years following a burst fracture sustained from a fall while hunting. The patient underwent a posterior fusion and decompression for stabilization, but there was no return of function. A baclofen pump was later inserted at the L3 level to manage spasticity. The patient has been receiving treatment for chronic pain with an FDA-approved stimulator.

**Objective:**  
The patient's spinal cord injury was classified as grade A according to the American Spinal Injury Association grading, indicating a complete loss of motor and sensory functions below the level of injury. 

**Procedure Details:**  
After obtaining informed consent, a total of 8 leads with 8 electrodes each were implanted at L2, L3, L4, and S1 bilaterally. Additionally, four leads with a total of 16 electrodes on each nerve root were implanted at L5 bilaterally. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with a small laminotomy at T12 to facilitate retrograde advancement and insertion of percutaneous leads to each level, guided under fluoroscopy. The total surgical time was approximately 120 minutes.

Two batteries, each with four ports, were utilized in the following configuration: 8 electrodes to D port for S1, 16 electrodes with a splitter to C port, 8 electrodes from L4 and 8 electrodes to L3 with a splitter to B port, and 8 electrodes to A port from L2. This configuration allowed for activation of every other contact on each lead plugged into the splitter. The electrodes were anchored into the interspinous ligament and tunneled to two separate gluteal pockets on either side. All electrodes from the left were connected to the left battery and right electrodes to the right battery. This setup provided a total of 64 contact points, 32 per battery, on 12 leads with implantation of 96 electrodes covering L2 to S1.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up appointments to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. The patient is encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
