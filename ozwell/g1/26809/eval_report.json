Both involve surgical intervention to reduce the hernia and reposition the kidney into the abdominal cavity. The first note details a 24-day-old female baby with a left-sided diaphragmatic defect, while the second note mentions a family history where the patient's aunt had a similar condition at birth. Both cases involve successful surgical repair and follow-up, with the aunt later developing renal cell carcinoma in the affected kidney. The notes highlight a potential familial link and concern about the risk of renal cell carcinoma."}}
