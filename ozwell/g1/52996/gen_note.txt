**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 44-year-old
- Ethnicity: Asian
- Gender: Male

**Chief Complaint:**
- Development of a mass on the penis 7 years ago.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports the development of a penile lesion approximately 7 years ago. Initially, the lesion was about 1 cm in diameter, accompanied by paresthesias and bleeding after friction. Urination remained normal. The patient did not seek medical attention at that time and instead applied erythromycin ointment when an ulcer developed. The ulceration occasionally healed but frequently recurred, with the lesion gradually increasing in size over the 7-year period. The patient eventually presented to the hospital for a penile lesion tissue biopsy, which revealed penile intraepithelial neoplasia. Due to the extensive range of lesions, the patient was admitted to the urological ward for hospitalization and surgical treatment.

**Medical History:**
- No history of exposure to chemical properties such as arsenic.
- HIV antibody test: Negative.
- No history of smoking or alcoholism.

**Physical Examination:**
- Lesion located on the ventral side of the penis, measuring approximately 2.2 cm × 2.0 cm.
- Surface of the penile lesion was pale red with a gray edge.
- No obvious redness or swelling of the surrounding skin.

**Surgical Procedure:**
Under continuous epidural anesthesia, a skin incision line was marked at a 1.0 cm margin from the edge of the penile lesion. The lesion tissue was completely resected on the surface of the deep fascia. Hemostasis was achieved using bipolar coagulation. A 5.0 cm × 3.0 cm scrotal flap was designed based on the resected wound area.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in 2 weeks. The patient was informed to reach out with any questions or concerns.

**Plan:**
- Monitor healing and recovery post-surgery.
- Evaluate for any signs of recurrence or complications during follow-up.
