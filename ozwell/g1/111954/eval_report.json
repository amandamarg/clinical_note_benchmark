Both describe a 36-year-old male patient with a history of ACL reconstruction six years ago, who is experiencing painful swelling and instability in the knee. They both mention the use of a hamstring graft for the ACL reconstruction, the patient's ability to walk normally after six months, and the onset of pain and swelling six years post-surgery without any trauma. Both notes highlight the patient's history of hyperuricemia, the physical examination findings, and the diagnostic tests showing early arthritic changes, effusion, and increased urate acid levels. They also describe the surgical findings of gouty crystals and the decision to delay ACL revision surgery. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of a clinical note header in the second note."}}
