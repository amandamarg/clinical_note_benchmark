They both mention the patient's initial DVT diagnosis following a femur fracture and surgery, the subsequent anticoagulation therapy, and the reevaluation of protein C and protein S deficiencies. Both notes conclude that the patient does not have these deficiencies based on further testing and recommend continuing anticoagulation treatment. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections in the clinical note."}}
