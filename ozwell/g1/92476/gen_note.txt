**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Patient ID:** [Patient's ID]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports being referred for evaluation of anticoagulation treatment. The primary care physician recommended lifelong anticoagulation due to deficiencies in protein C and protein S. The patient denies any personal or family history of DVT or coagulation abnormalities. 

**History of Present Illness:**  
In 2006, the patient sustained a right femur fracture from a fall at work, treated with a titanium rod insertion. Post-surgery, the patient experienced right calf pain and was diagnosed with DVT via Doppler ultrasonography. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin was initiated. The patient was maintained on 9 mg Coumadin and 325 mg aspirin until June 2007, when spontaneous bruising and large hematomas were noted. A reevaluation of anticoagulation was requested, and a thrombophilia workup was conducted while on therapeutic Coumadin. Initial lab results indicated protein S activity at 36% [normal range 54-130%] and protein C activity at 10% [normal range 70-130%], leading to a diagnosis of protein C and protein S deficiency. Protein C and protein S antigen levels were not performed.

**Objective:**  
In our laboratory, a blood sample was drawn while the patient was on Coumadin. Citrate platelet poor plasma was prepared, showing a normal coagulation profile and response to Coumadin, with no evidence of thrombophilia. Fibrinogen levels were not elevated, and no abnormal fibrinogen variants were detected. Antithrombin levels were at 100%, consistent with long-term Coumadin use. Protein C and protein S levels were within the expected range for the degree of anticoagulation.

**Assessment:**  
The patient does not have a protein C or protein S deficiency based on our laboratory results. The initial diagnosis of deficiency was likely influenced by the therapeutic Coumadin dose at the time of testing.

**Plan:**  
Continue current anticoagulation treatment. Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months. The patient was advised to contact the office if any symptoms or concerns arise before the next scheduled visit.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient expressed no questions or concerns and trusts the medical judgment provided.

**Follow-Up:**  
Next appointment scheduled in three months.
