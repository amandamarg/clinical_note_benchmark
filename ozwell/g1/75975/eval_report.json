They both describe the case of a 12-year-old female with an ectopic upper left canine and buccal alveolar expansion. Both notes mention the referral by an orthodontist, the examination findings, radiographic and CT results, exploration and biopsy under general anesthetic, histopathology results, and the assessment and plan for follow-up. The main difference is in the format and some minor details, but the core information and conclusions are consistent across both notes."}}
