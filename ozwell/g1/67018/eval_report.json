They both mention the patient's past medical history, including epilepsy, cardiopulmonary arrest, peritonitis, venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Both notes also discuss the patient's allergies and surgical history, particularly the omental implantation and the detection of a right ovarian tumor diagnosed as a mature cystic teratoma. Additionally, they both describe the current admission due to symptoms like appetite loss, nausea, and vomiting, and the findings of an enlarged ovarian tumor. However, the first note provides a more detailed account of the surgical findings and histological analysis, while the second note outlines a plan for further tests and follow-up."}}
