Both notes mention the patient's complaint of right shoulder pain, its duration, and its impact on daily activities and sleep. They also both reference the history of a painless snap during sports activity 11 years ago and the absence of relevant family or medical history.\n\nThe first note provides a detailed account of the patient's surgical procedure, postoperative course, and long-term follow-up, including specific surgical findings and histological examination results. It also includes detailed imaging findings and the final diagnosis of a solitary osteochondroma (OC) with a large bursa.\n\nThe second note is more concise, focusing on the initial presentation, physical examination findings, and imaging results. It mentions the suspicion of a malignant bone tumor and the plan for further examination and biopsy but does not include surgical details or long-term follow-up.\n\nOverall, the notes are similar in describing the patient's condition and initial assessment but differ in the level of detail and the aspects of the case they emphasize."}}
