**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:31:37 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Complaint:** Pain in the right shoulder  
- **Duration:** 3 months  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a pain in the right shoulder that began approximately 3 months ago, initially associated with continuous computer use. The pain has progressively worsened, now affecting daily activities and sleep, particularly in the supine position. The patient recalls a painless snap in the back 11 years ago during sports activity, which resolved after discontinuing the activity 2 years later. There is no relevant family or medical history related to bone problems.

**Physical Examination:**  
- **Right Shoulder:** Slightly lower than the left shoulder  
- **Neurological Deficits:** None in the right shoulder or arm  
- **Scapula:** Winging of the right scapula with the arm at the side  
- **Back Muscle:** No atrophy; normal contraction of the trapezius  
- **Rotator Cuff and Short Rotators:** Muscle bellies are not tender and without defects  
- **Active Range of Motion Limitations:**  
  - Total elevation: 10°  
  - External rotation: 15°  
  - Internal rotation: Limited by two vertebrae  
- **Horizontal Adduction:** Not limited with moderate pain beyond 100°  
- **Empty Can Test:** Generates upper scapular pain  
- **Deformities/Osseous Tumors:** None palpable in large joints, pelvis, or ribcage  

**Imaging Findings:**  
- **Radiographs:** Bone mass extruding from the ventral side of the superomedial scapular angle; no abnormalities in large joints  
- **Computed Tomography:** Mushroom-shaped osseous tumor with a cortex continuous with the scapular cortex, broad flat distal end nearly contacting the third rib, and a soft tissue tumor  

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient was referred to our hospital with a suspicion of a malignant bone tumor based on previous radiographic and MRI findings. Further examination and treatment are necessary. A specialist consultation and biopsy will be arranged to determine the exact diagnosis.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for a specialist consultation and biopsy. Further management will be based on the biopsy results.
