Both describe the case of a woman with right trigeminal neuralgia that began in March 2012, which was initially unresponsive to medication. They both mention the development of skin lesions on the face, the ineffectiveness of various treatments (medication, Fogarty rhizotomy, and right suboccipital decompression with the Janetta microsurgical technique), and the decision to proceed with radiosurgery using the CyberKnife technique. Both notes also highlight the patient's psychological distress and weight loss due to the pain and facial lesions. The clinical note provides a structured format with specific sections like Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Previous Treatments, Additional Information, Plan, and Follow-Up, while the other note is more narrative in style."}}
