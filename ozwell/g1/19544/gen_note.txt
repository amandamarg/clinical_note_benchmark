**Time:** 8:31:38 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right trigeminal neuralgia with associated skin lesions.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing right trigeminal neuralgia since March 2012. Initial treatment with medication was ineffective. Approximately one year after the onset of pain, the patient developed skin lesions on the face. A biopsy and pathology assessment ruled out herpes and other infectious and dermatological diseases. The lesions, which are painless, have increased in size and are located in areas innervated by the right cranial nerve V. The patient reports severe paroxysmal pain crises in the three branches of the right trigeminal nerve daily, which have not responded to any treatment. The patient has also experienced significant weight loss and psychological distress due to the pain and facial lesions.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Right trigeminal neuralgia since March 2012.
- Skin lesions on the face, ruled out for infectious and dermatological diseases.

**Previous Treatments:**  
- Medication for trigeminal neuralgia (ineffective).
- Fogarty rhizotomy (ineffective).
- Right suboccipital decompression with Janetta microsurgical technique due to clinical suspicion of vascular compression (ineffective).

**Additional Information:**  
The patient did not report any repeated manipulations in the innervation zone of the trigeminal nerve but did use a bandage on the face to try to improve the skin lesions, which was not effective.

**Plan:**  
The patient will undergo radiosurgery using the CyberKnife technique to control the pain. The patient will be informed about the radiosurgical procedure and will sign the consent. A reinforced immobilization thermoplastic mask will be made, which has a greater thickness than the typical mask, to increase its rigidity and further decrease the possibility of head movement in order to achieve greater precision. Planning neuroimaging will be performed with a simple CT.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored for response to the radiosurgical procedure and any changes in symptoms or lesion presentation. Further management will be based on the outcome of the radiosurgery.
