**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. X  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. Y, Cardiologist  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient, Mr. X, presented with a history of coronary artery disease and chronic atrial fibrillation. He was admitted for a bypass grafting procedure. The patient reported feeling okay at the time of the consultation.

**Medications:**  
- Aspirin  
- Beta blockers  
- Nitrates  
(Note: The patient is not on any anticoagulation medication.)

**Objective:**  
- **Transthoracic Echocardiography:** Revealed mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40% to 45% and mild dilation of both atria. No interatrial septal aneurysm was noted.
- **Coronary Angiography:** Showed severe stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery.
- **Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE):** Revealed a large echogenic mass in the right atrium, initially thought to be a large myxoma or thrombus attached to the atrial septum. A visible deficiency in the mass suggested possible detachment of part of the thrombus.
- **Agitated Saline Test:** After bolus injection in the right jugular vein with automated contrast and provocation maneuvers, a patent foramen ovale was established.

**Procedure:**  
During cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient became hemodynamically unstable and was urgently introduced into extracorporeal circulation. After the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP), the aneurysm was initially resected, and the bypass grafting was successfully performed.

**Outcome:**  
Despite the administration of inotropic agents, the patient eventually died. Condolences were offered to the patient's family, who expressed their appreciation for the care provided.

**Plan:**  
The family was advised to reach out with any questions or concerns. Further support and resources were offered as needed.
