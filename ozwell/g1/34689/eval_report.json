Both describe the medical history and condition of a 75-year-old man who was scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting due to coronary artery disease and chronic atrial fibrillation. They both mention the patient's medications, the findings from various echocardiography tests, and the procedure that was performed. Both notes also describe the outcome of the procedure, which was ultimately fatal, and mention the family's response and the support offered to them. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the first note being more narrative and the second note being more structured with headings like \"Subjective,\" \"Objective,\" \"Procedure,\" \"Outcome,\" and \"Plan.\""}}
