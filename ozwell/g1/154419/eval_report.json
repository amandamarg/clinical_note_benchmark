Both describe the case of a 46-year-old female patient with a cystic tumor in the pancreatic body and tail. They detail the preoperative diagnosis of a benign mucinous cystic tumor, the surgical procedure of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with robotic assistance, and the challenges faced during surgery due to the close adherence of the cystic tumor to the splenic vessels. Both notes mention the estimated blood loss, the absence of a blood transfusion, and the delivery of the specimen through a small incision. The postoperative course is described similarly, with the patient recovering without complications, resuming an oral diet on the second day, and being discharged on the fifth day. The final pathology report in both notes confirms a benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without malignant potential. Additionally, both notes mention a follow-up color Doppler ultrasound scan showing no evidence of splenic infarction and well-preserved blood flow within the spleen."}}
