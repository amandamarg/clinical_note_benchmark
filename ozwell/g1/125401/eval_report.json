Both notes include details about the endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, biopsy results, abdominal CT scan findings, surgical intervention, and gross pathology. They also mention the resolution of melena following the tumor removal and the follow-up plan. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the first note being more detailed and narrative, while the second note is structured as a clinical note with sections for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan."}}
