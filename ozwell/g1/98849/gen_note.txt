**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:15:30 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe chest pain for the past few days. 

**Objective:**  
- Medical history includes anterior wall myocardial infarction.  
- Previous echocardiography showed akinesia of the anterior septum and anterior wall, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.  
- During admission to the coronary care unit, the patient exhibited decreased blood pressure and urine output.  
- Despite inotropic administration, the patient's condition did not improve.  
- Bedside portable echocardiography indicated low mitral E velocity and reversed E/A ratio, suggesting volume depletion or dehydration.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient was diagnosed with volume depletion, which was confirmed by Doppler echocardiographic findings. 

**Plan:**  
- Administered fluid rather than diuretics or volume restriction, resulting in improved condition, increased blood pressure, and urine output.  
- Emphasized the importance of volume expansion as the first therapeutic measure in cases of hemodynamic instability, while noting the potential hazards in patients with high preload, particularly in elderly patients with decreased left ventricular compliance.  
- Highlighted the need for close monitoring to maintain a balance between excessive pulmonary congestion and reduced preload.  
- Discussed the role of diuretics in relieving congestion and edema, with caution to avoid overdiuresis and its complications.  
- Noted that patients with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction will not benefit from diuretic therapy due to typically normal filling pressures at rest.  
- Echocardiographic evaluation is essential to identify patients who would benefit from diuresis.  

**Follow-up:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary.  

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient expressed understanding of the treatment plan and had no further questions.
