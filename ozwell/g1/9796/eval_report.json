They both describe the clinical case of a 90-year-old diabetic woman who was admitted with diffuse abdominal pain and cough, diagnosed with sepsis, and later found to have acute cholecystitis. Both notes detail the laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure, the incidental finding of a left-sided gallbladder, and the postoperative complications of aggravated diabetes and basal pneumonia. They also mention the retrospective analysis of a CT scan and the evaluation of vascular and biliary reconstruction, noting the agenesis of the right anterior sector of the liver and the intrahepatic variation classified as type A3 of Huang Classification. The structure and content of the notes are very similar, with minor differences in wording and organization."}}
