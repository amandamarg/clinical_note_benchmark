Both describe the patient's history of a giant cell tumor treated in 1991, the recurrence and subsequent treatment with curettage and cementation, and the patient's current presentation with knee pain and functional impairment. They both detail the physical examination findings, including the knee scar, varus deformity, and range of motion. The radiographic findings of a large bolus of cement and joint space narrowing are also mentioned in both notes. The assessment and plan for a total knee replacement, considering the good quality of the cement bed, are consistent in both notes. The surgical findings and procedure are described in detail, including the use of a cruciate retaining femoral component and the preparation of the proximal tibia and patella resurfacing. Both notes conclude with a follow-up plan for the patient."}}
