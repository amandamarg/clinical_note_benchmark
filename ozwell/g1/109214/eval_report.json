Both describe the case of a 54-year-old female with a giant left ICA aneurysm discovered incidentally during a workup for headaches. They detail the initial findings, including the size and location of the aneurysm, and the treatment history involving parent vessel occlusion. Both notes mention the follow-up angiograms showing persistent retrograde filling of the aneurysm through the PCOM artery and the eventual treatment with a flow diverter stent. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, focusing on the chief complaint, history of present illness, treatment history, follow-up, and assessment and plan."}}
