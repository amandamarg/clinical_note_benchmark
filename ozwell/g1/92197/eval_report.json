They detail the clinical examination findings, including the differences between the superior and inferior limbs, the results of imaging studies, and the surgical plan to transfer the inferior limb to the superior forearm. Both notes mention the postoperative outcomes and the plan for further procedures. However, the second note includes an additional section about the unfortunate passing of the patient and the discussion with the family, which is not present in the first note."}}
