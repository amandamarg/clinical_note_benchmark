Both describe a 50-year-old male patient experiencing pain in the thoracolumbar area, who has been taking NSAIDs (specifically diclofenac) for pain relief. They both mention a bone scintigraphy performed to rule out micro fractures, which showed diffuse uptake of technetium in the kidneys but no significant activities indicating micro fractures. Both notes discuss the patient's medical history, lack of oncologic or chronic disease, and normotensive status. They also include similar diagnostic test results, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values, and urine microscopy findings. The assessment in both notes points to acute kidney injury likely caused by NSAID use, and the plan involves discontinuing diclofenac and scheduling a follow-up appointment."}}
