Both describe a clinical case involving an 11-year-old female patient with an accessory oral cavity present since birth. They detail the examination findings, including the presence of two oral cavities, the asymmetry of the mandible, and the specific characteristics of the accessory oral cavity. Both notes also mention the surgical procedure performed to remove the accessory mouth and associated cystic lesion, as well as the postoperative outcome. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed account of the surgical procedure and histopathological findings, while the second note focuses on the clinical examination and assessment plan."}}
