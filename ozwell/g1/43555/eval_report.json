Both describe a 58-year-old male patient with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and subsequent metastases. They detail the development of a mass in the posterior thigh, initially misdiagnosed as a blood clot, and later identified as a metastasis from RCC. Both notes mention the patient's past medical history, including nephrectomy and resection of the pancreas and spleen due to metastasis. They also describe the diagnostic process involving FDG-PET/CT and MRI, leading to the surgical resection of the mass. The outcome is the same in both notes, with the patient passing away due to the advanced nature of the metastasis. The main difference is the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other a narrative description."}}
