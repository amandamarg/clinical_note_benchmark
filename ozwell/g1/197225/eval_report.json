Both notes highlight the challenges she faced due to her ASD diagnosis, which was not initially known to the home care staff or her parents. They both mention the difficulties in communication and managing home care tasks, as well as the eventual improvement in her caregiving abilities after receiving consultation and social skill training. The notes also cover the emotional and practical challenges she faced, particularly in understanding her family's emotions and the situation's gravity. The outcome of the mother's peaceful passing and the daughter's ability to handle the situation is also noted in both. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information is more narrative and detailed."}}
