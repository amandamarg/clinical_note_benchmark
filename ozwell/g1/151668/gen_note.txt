**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:23:40 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe pain in the right elbow, swelling, and numbness in fingers.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with severe pain and swelling in the right elbow, along with numbness in the fingers. The patient reported a fall at home, resulting in a dislocated elbow, which was initially reduced and immobilized with a slab at another hospital. The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation due to persistent symptoms.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Swelling observed around the right elbow.  
- Mild stretch pain reported by the patient.  
- Decreased sensation in the fingers.

**Investigations:**  
- X-ray of the right elbow: Well-reduced elbow, no evidence of fracture.  
- Arterial Doppler scan: Large hematoma causing extrinsic compression over the distal end of the brachial artery.

**Procedures and Findings:**  
- Brachial artery exploration under general anesthesia revealed a complete brachial artery rupture.  
- Referred to a vascular surgeon for further management.  
- CT-angiography showed complete right brachial artery transection 5 cm above the elbow with thrombus in both ends.  
- Treatment included excision of the injured segment of the vessel, right transbrachial proximal and distal thrombectomy, and artery reconstruction by interposition repair using the right great saphenous vein graft.  
- Forearm fasciotomy was performed in anticipation of compartment syndrome and reperfusion injury.

**Postoperative Care:**  
- Elbow immobilized in an above elbow slab.  
- Administered antibiotics, analgesics, and anticoagulants.

**Follow-up:**  
- Sutures to be removed on the 15th postoperative day.  
- Skin grafting planned.
