They both describe the case of a 58-year-old woman who sustained a posterior dislocation of her right elbow following a fall. Both notes detail the initial treatment with closed reduction and immobilization, followed by referral to another hospital due to severe pain, swelling, and numbness. They describe the findings of a large hematoma and complete brachial artery rupture, leading to surgical intervention including artery reconstruction and fasciotomy. Postoperative care and follow-up plans are also consistent between the two notes."}}
