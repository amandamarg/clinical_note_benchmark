They both describe the medical history and recent procedure of a 78-year-old male patient with coronary artery disease and a history of stent placement. Both notes detail the discovery of a lung nodule, subsequent testing, and the decision to perform a robotic-assisted resection using the Da Vinci Xi robot. They describe the procedure, including the use of indocyanine green angiography and the steps taken to resect the lesions and reconstruct the airway. Both notes confirm that the lesions were benign and that the patient was discharged without complications. The main difference is the format and some specific details, such as the time and date of the clinical note."}}
