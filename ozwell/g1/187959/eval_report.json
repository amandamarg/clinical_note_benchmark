Both notes mention the initial conservative approach with composite fillings for the upper front teeth and the need for implants in the posterior superior quadrants. They also describe the patient's return in 2017 with pain in the upper left canine, the discovery of new subgingival caries, and the decision to proceed with an implant-supported bridge. The treatment process, including the staged approach with extractions, implants, and temporary bridges, is detailed in both notes. The main difference is that the second note includes a clinical note dated 10/1/2025, which provides a summary of the patient's condition, subjective and objective findings, assessment, plan, follow-up, treatment, and outcome."}}
