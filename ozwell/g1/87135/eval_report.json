They both describe the case of a 10-month-old girl who experienced a fall, followed by the development of right-sided weakness and facial palsy. Both notes detail the clinical findings, including muscle power, Babinski sign, and the absence of signs of raised intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation. They also mention the normal results of routine blood tests and the MRI finding of an acute infarct in the left capsuloganglionic region. The management with osmotic diuretics and anticoagulant therapy is consistent in both notes. However, there is a significant difference in the outcome: one note describes the child being discharged with improvement, while the other states that the child unfortunately passed away."}}
