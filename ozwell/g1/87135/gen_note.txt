**History of Present Illness:**
The patient was brought to the emergency room after a fall on her head. There was no loss of consciousness, vomiting, or convulsions immediately following the injury. The next day, the patient developed weakness on the right side of her face, arm, and leg, and was unable to sit or stand. She remained conscious and active but exhibited decreased movements in the right half of her body.

- Facial palsy: Right-sided UMN type
- Babinski sign: Positive on the right side
- No signs of raised intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation
- Other neurological examinations: Normal

- Perinatal history was uneventful

**Family History:**

**Social History:**

**Immunization History:**

**Investigations:**
- Routine blood count, peripheral smear, serum electrolytes, bleeding, and coagulation profile: Within normal limits
- MRI brain: Acute infarct involving the left capsuloganglionic region

**Management:**
The patient was managed conservatively with osmotic diuretics to reduce perilesional edema. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated with low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously for a total of 5 days, which was then stopped without continuation of oral antiplatelet therapy. Due to financial constraints, further investigations such as MRA, Doppler evaluation of the vessels, lipoprotein A and homocysteine estimation, protein C and S, antithrombin III, and antiphospholipid antibody were not conducted.

**Outcome:**
Unfortunately, the patient passed away despite the medical interventions. The cause of death was related to the acute infarct in the brain. The family was informed and expressed gratitude for the care provided.
