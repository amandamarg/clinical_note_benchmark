Both describe the same patient's case, detailing the symptoms of acute eye pain, headache, fatigue, and weakness in the legs. They both mention the initial examination by a neurologist, the spinal tap procedure, and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, both notes describe the development of a severe headache after the spinal tap, the patient's travel to the USA for further treatment, and the subsequent diagnosis of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). The treatment plan involving bed rest and follow-up appointments is also consistent in both notes."}}
