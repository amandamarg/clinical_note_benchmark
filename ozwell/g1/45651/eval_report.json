They both describe the case of a 19-year-old male with dental pain and sensitivity in the anterior maxillary region, a history of childhood asthma, and no history of trauma. Both notes mention poor oral hygiene, multiple caries, and the rare finding of twinning in the central incisors. They describe the absence of a lateral incisor on the right side and the presence of a large central incisor with a dental projection. On the left side, both central and lateral incisors are present, with the left incisor having a large groove. Both notes detail the endodontic treatment performed, including the use of local anesthesia, access cavity preparation, canal irrigation, and obturation. The socioeconomic status of the patient is noted as a factor in delaying treatment. The plan includes prescribing necessary treatments and scheduling a follow-up appointment."}}
