Both notes detail the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of lupus undergoing elective left total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. They describe the patient's previous left knee ACL reconstruction, the surgical procedure including the use of a medial parapatellar arthrotomy, measured resection technique, and the challenges faced during the surgery such as the femoral component overhang, the removal of the bone mulch screw, and the fractures of the femoral condyles. Both notes also mention the intraoperative consultation and the eventual decision to use a distal femoral replacement. However, there is a significant difference in the outcome: one note states that the patient was discharged home and was doing well postoperatively, while the other note states that the patient did not survive the surgery."}}
