Both describe the medical history, symptoms, and treatment of a 17-year-old female patient with osteosarcoma. They detail the presence of a 7-cm mass on the left side of the skull, the patient's severe headache and vision loss, and the surgical procedures performed to remove the tumor. Both notes mention the influence of pregnancy hormones on the tumor's growth, the CT scan findings, and the post-operative recovery and treatment plan, including the scheduled radiotherapy. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a concise summary, while the context information offers a more detailed narrative of the patient's condition and treatment."}}
