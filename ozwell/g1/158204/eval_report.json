Both notes mention the initial diagnosis, the obstruction of the right upper lobar bronchus, the development of postobstructive pneumonia, and the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy. They also describe the patient's refusal of curative treatment, the subsequent development of symptoms such as cough and blood-tinged sputum, and the interventions undertaken, including bronchoscopy, external beam radiotherapy, and the insertion of bronchial stents. The notes detail the decision-making process regarding treatment options and the outcome of the procedures. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note, with the clinical note providing a more structured overview of the patient's medical history, treatment, and follow-up plan."}}
