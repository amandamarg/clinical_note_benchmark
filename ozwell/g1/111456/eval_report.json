Both describe the case of a 54-year-old Hispanic male with left-sided trigeminal neuralgia (TN) that began in 2019. They detail the initial treatment with carbamazepine, the worsening of symptoms, and the lack of improvement with various medications. Both notes mention the patient's hospitalization due to intractable pain and suicidal ideations, the family history of Chiari malformation, and the neurological examination findings. They also describe the therapeutic interventions attempted, including opioids, fosphenytoin, triptans, benzodiazepines, ketamine infusion, and a trigeminal nerve block, all with minimal relief. The notes mention the imaging studies conducted and the eventual consultation with the neurosurgical team, leading to a surgical intervention that resulted in significant improvement. The main difference is the level of detail and the specific wording used in each note."}}
