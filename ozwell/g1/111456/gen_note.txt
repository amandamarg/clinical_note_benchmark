**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe, frequent intermittent episodes of left-sided facial pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient is a [age redacted] year-old individual with no significant past medical or surgical history who developed left-sided trigeminal neuralgia (TN) in 2019. Initially, the patient was started on carbamazepine 400 mg twice daily, which provided reasonable control of neuralgic pain, allowing continuation of work until late 2020. However, symptoms gradually worsened, leading to severe, frequent episodes of left-sided facial pain, minimal oral intake, and inadequate sleep. Despite maximized doses of carbamazepine and trials of gabapentin, phenytoin, opioids, and NSAIDs, there was no improvement. The patient had three ER visits within 10 days and was hospitalized due to intractable pain and suicidal ideations.

**Family History:**  
Family history of Chiari malformation reported in one sibling.

**Physical Examination:**  
Vital signs were normal. Neurological examination revealed hyperalgesia in the left lower V1 and throughout the entire left V2 cranial nerve distribution.

**Therapeutic Interventions:**  
Escalating doses of intravenous opioids, fosphenytoin loads, and subcutaneous triptans were administered with minimal relief. Sedation with benzodiazepines was required to manage pain and severe suicidal thoughts. After five days of unsuccessful therapeutic interventions, the patient was transferred to a tertiary care facility under neurology and internal medicine care. A trial of ketamine infusion was attempted but discontinued due to hallucinations. A trigeminal nerve block provided minimal and transient relief.

**Imaging Studies:**  
Multiple imaging studies, including Brain MRI and CT angiogram, were conducted but did not identify an etiology.

**Plan:**  
Given the refractoriness to medical interventions, the neurosurgical team was consulted for further management.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be kept updated with the latest medical interventions and management strategies.
