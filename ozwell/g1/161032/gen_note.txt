**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 12 years old
- Gender: Not specified

**Chief Complaint:**
- Intermittent dull ache in the left thigh for the past 6 months.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports a dull ache in the left thigh that comes and goes. There is no history of trauma or injury associated with the onset of pain.

**Physical Examination:**
- No palpable mass or tenderness in the left thigh.
- Full range of motion observed in the left leg.

**Diagnostic Imaging and Tests:**
1. **Radiograph:**
   - Osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions in the left distal femoral metaphysis.
   - No periosteal reaction or destruction observed.

2. **MRI:**
   - T1 low and T2 heterogeneous signal intensity intramedullary lesion in the metaphysis.
   - Lesion has not crossed the growth plate and shows no definite destruction.

3. **Radiologist Report:**
   - Findings consistent with osteosarcoma, but the possibility of a benign lesion cannot be excluded.

4. **Whole Body Bone Scan:**
   - Mild increased uptake in the left distal femur.

5. **Laboratory Tests:**
   - Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and blood chemistry all within normal limits.

6. **Incisional Biopsy:**
   - Lesion with many irregular shaped and sclerotic mature and immature bony trabeculae.
   - Moderately cellular stroma composed of relatively uniform spindle cells and cartilaginous components without significant cellular atypia.

**Assessment and Plan:**
- The diagnosis is not easily made, and the possibility of a benign lesion remains.
- After a case conference discussion and consultations with foreign pathologic specialists, it was decided to proceed with close observation without further invasive procedures or surgical treatments.
- The patient is experiencing minimal symptoms of intermittent pain, and the parents agreed with this plan of action.

**Follow-Up:**
- Thirty-six months after the initial visit, radiologic findings from plain radiographs and MRI showed no significant interval changes in extent and morphology.
- Whole body bone scan showed mild decreased uptake compared to the initial scan.
- The patient is now clinically pain-free.
