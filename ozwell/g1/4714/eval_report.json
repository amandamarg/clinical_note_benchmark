Both notes cover the timeline of her condition, starting from the initial breast augmentation in 1995, the discovery of symptoms in 2014, and the subsequent medical interventions from 2016 onwards. They detail the surgical procedures, pathology findings, radiation therapy, and follow-up care. The main difference is that the clinical note is a more concise summary, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of her medical journey, including her decline and eventual passing in 2017."}}
