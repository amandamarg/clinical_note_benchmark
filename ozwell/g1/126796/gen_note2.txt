**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:37:16 AM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe stabbing pain in the right side of the mandible radiating to the right ear, occurring for the past 5 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe stabbing pain on the right side of the mandible that radiates to the right ear. The pain occurs spontaneously or is triggered by chewing and tooth brushing, lasting for a few seconds in each attack. The patient was previously diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) at another hospital and was prescribed carbamazepine, which provided only partial relief. The patient experienced a pain-free period for about 1 month before presenting to our clinic. However, the condition worsened in the last few days prior to admission, with increased frequency and severity of pain. The patient stopped taking the medication on their own decision.

**Review of Systems:**  
- Neurological and nasopharyngeal assessments: Normal findings  
- Laboratory tests and electrocardiogram: Normal  
- Computed tomography of the neck and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain: Normal results  

**Assessment:**  
The patient's symptoms fulfill the criteria for trigeminal neuralgia. On the first visit, pain paroxysms occurred four or five times daily with a visual analogue scale of 100, indicating the worst pain possible. The duration of pain attacks was measured in a few seconds. The patient underwent a mandibular nerve block with alcohol after a test block with 1% mepivacaine. Despite the right V3 innervated area being anesthetized and pain-free after the V3 alcohol block, the patient still complained of right ear pain.

**Events During Procedure:**  
Ten minutes after the procedure, the patient developed paroxysmal pain in the right ear and experienced faintness and loss of consciousness with convulsive movement for about 1 minute. A neurologist was consulted to exclude seizure disorders, and the electroencephalogram showed no abnormalities. Unfortunately, a brain MRI could not be performed due to convulsive movement during the pain attack.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be consulted with a cardiologist for further evaluation. Follow-up requirements will be instructed to the patient.
