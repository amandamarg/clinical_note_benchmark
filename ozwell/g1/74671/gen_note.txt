**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Swelling on the right side of the face, lower part, growing over the past 8 months.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a painless swelling on the right side of the face, specifically affecting the lower part. The swelling has been progressively growing over the past 8 months.  

**Examination:**  
Upon examination, the swelling was noted to affect the body and angle of the mandible on the right side.  

**Investigations:**  
- **Panoramic Radiographic Examination:** Revealed a unilocular radiolucent lesion extending from the body of the mandible through to the angle and right ascending ramus.  
- **CT Scan:** Showed expansion of the buccal and lingual aspects of the cortical bone with areas of fenestration.  

**Procedures:**  
- **Needle Aspiration:** Performed to evaluate the contents of the swelling.  
- **Incisional Biopsy:** Conducted for histological evaluation.  

**Diagnosis:**  
Unicystic ameloblastoma.  

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Initiated assisted decompression approach using daily irrigations of sterile saline solution intercalated with 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate to remove debris and decontaminate the site.  
- Follow-up both clinically and radiographically.  

**Progress:**  
After 5 months of decompression, significant reduction of the lesion was observed radiographically, with evidence of bone neoformation in the periphery of the lesion.  

**Surgical Intervention:**  
Complete enucleation of the lesion combined with peripheral osteotomy and cryotherapy was performed under general anesthesia to reduce the risk of recurrence.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up appointments to monitor the healing process and ensure there is no recurrence.  

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the site closely for any signs of recurrence.
