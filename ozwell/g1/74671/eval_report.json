Both describe the case of a 12-year-old Brazilian female with a painless growing facial swelling on the right side of her face, specifically affecting the lower part. They both mention the swelling affecting the body and angle of the mandible, the investigations conducted (panoramic radiographic examination and CT scan), and the procedures performed (needle aspiration and incisional biopsy). Both notes confirm the diagnosis of unicystic ameloblastoma and outline the treatment plan involving assisted decompression and subsequent surgical intervention. They also mention the follow-up plan to monitor for recurrence. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with specific headings, while the context information is more narrative."}}
