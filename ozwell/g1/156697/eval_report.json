Both describe the case of a 41-year-old woman with a 2-year history of a palpable mass in the right lateral aspect of the neck. They detail the absence of past irradiation or trauma, the findings from physical examination, and the results from various diagnostic tests such as ultrasonography, CT, and FNAC. Both notes assess the condition as presumed metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right lateral neck and occult papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right thyroid gland. They also describe the surgical intervention of right lateral neck dissection followed by total thyroidectomy and the histopathologic findings. The follow-up plan and management with levothyroxine replacement are also mentioned in both notes."}}
