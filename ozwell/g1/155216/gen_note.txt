**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:55 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Bipolar Affective Disorder  
- **Medication:** Olanzapine (2.5-10 mg/day), previously Trihexyphenidyl (4 mg/day for 3 weeks)  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Discomfort in neck and lower back  
- Inability to maintain an erect posture  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with discomfort in the neck and lower back, reporting difficulty in maintaining an erect posture. The patient experiences a tendency to fall to either side when standing up from a sitting position, with the head persistently turned to the right and upwards. The patient reports pain and discomfort in the neck, alongside a sideways bending in the lumbar region. To counteract the abnormal positioning, the patient maintains specific limb positions to support body weight. These symptoms have been present for the past four months, coinciding with the introduction of olanzapine tablets for exacerbated mental illness. The patient has been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder for seven years, with the first episode of mania occurring at age eleven. The patient has been on olanzapine for seven years, with symptoms of neck pain and discomfort developing within the second week of a 5 mg/day dose. The sustained and abnormal contraction of neck muscles pulls the head to the right in an upward direction. These symptoms have persisted for the first three years of the illness with varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction, correlating with the dose of olanzapine. A brief period of trihexyphenidyl 4 mg/day was prescribed for upper limb rigidity, showing a good response.

**Impact on Daily Life:**  
The patient requires assistance with standing and walking, and parents assist with daily chores, including all activities of self-care.

**Plan:**  
- Order diagnostic tests to further evaluate the condition.  
- Provide instructions on follow-up requirements.
