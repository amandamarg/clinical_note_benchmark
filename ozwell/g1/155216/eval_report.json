They both describe the case of a sixteen-year-old girl with bipolar affective disorder who has been experiencing discomfort in the neck and lower back, difficulty maintaining an erect posture, and abnormal muscle contractions. Both notes mention the introduction of olanzapine as a treatment for her mental illness and the subsequent development of symptoms. They also discuss the history of her illness, the impact on her daily life, and the plan for further evaluation and follow-up. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's history and treatment."}}
