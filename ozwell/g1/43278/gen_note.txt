**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe pain in the right thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe pain in the right thigh for several months. The pain is described as severe and has been persistent.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Diagnosed with a bone tumor of the right proximal femur at age 20.
- Underwent surgery for tumor removal, followed by one cycle of postoperative chemotherapy and local irradiation.
- Two years post-operation, developed severe right thigh pain after braking hard while driving, requiring open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nails.
- Subsequent incident of severe right thigh pain after stubbing toe, treated conservatively, with roentgenograms demonstrating bone union.

**Current Evaluation:**  
- Radiographs revealed a lytic lesion from the trochanteric area to the proximal diaphysis.
- MRI showed an intramedullary lesion with an extraskeletal mass.
- Metastatic work-up was negative.
- Open biopsy from the intertrochanteric lesion performed.

**Pathology Findings:**  
- Microscopic findings: Malignant small round cell neoplasm with regular nuclear contours and finely dispersed chromatin without prominent nucleoli, similar to findings from the initial surgery at age 20.
- Immunohistochemical and histochemical staining: Neoplasm positive for glycogen (PAS).

**Assessment:**  
The findings indicate a malignant neoplasm similar to the one diagnosed 20 years ago.

**Plan:**  
Discuss further treatment options with the patient and develop a treatment plan. Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor progress.

**Follow-up:**  
A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to assess the patient's progress and discuss treatment options.
