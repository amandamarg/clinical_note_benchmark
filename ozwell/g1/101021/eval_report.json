They both describe the medical case of a 24-year-old pregnant woman with a history of a septate uterus and previous medical abortions, who presented with premature rupture of membranes and threat of premature labor. Both notes detail the birth of a male neonate at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation by cesarean section, the presence of an amniotic band around the neonate's right upper limb, and the subsequent medical interventions, including the amputation of the limb. The postoperative course and follow-up care are also similarly described in both notes."}}
