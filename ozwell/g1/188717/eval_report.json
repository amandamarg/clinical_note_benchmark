They both detail the patient's initial presentation with right arm pain and swelling, the diagnosis of primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis, and the subsequent treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Both notes mention the complications of thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression, the patient's intractable pain, and the use of opioid therapy. They also describe the diagnostic brachial plexus block and the consideration of further pain management options. The main difference is that the second note includes an outcome section mentioning the patient's passing and a family discussion, which is not present in the first note."}}
