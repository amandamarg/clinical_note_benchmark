Both describe the medical history and recent medical events of a 56-year-old woman who presented with rectal bleeding, mucus passage, and a change in bowel habits. They both mention her history of bladder exstrophy, multiple surgeries, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The notes detail the findings from a colonoscopy, including the presence of two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, and the decision to perform a high anterior resection with an open approach due to suspected intra-abdominal adhesions. Both notes also mention the formation of an end colostomy at the patient's request and her uneventful recovery with a good quality of life post-surgery. The main difference is in the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other a more narrative description."}}
