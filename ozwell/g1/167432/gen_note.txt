**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits, which have been ongoing for approximately 6 months. The patient reports passing mucus and experiencing more frequent stools. There have been no abdominal pains or changes in weight. The patient has a history of bladder exstrophy and has undergone multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5. The patient has experienced recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood. There are no major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy and no family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
During a colonoscopy, two large sessile polyps were found in the sigmoid colon, exhibiting irregular patterns suggestive of focally advanced disease. The polyps were removed during surgery, and histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia, but without submucosal invasion. Atypical mucosa was noted around a diverticulum-like structure, but it was not adenomatous. The rest of the colonoscopy was unremarkable with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
Endoscopic resection was considered but not pursued due to difficult endoscopic access and suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgery. The patient underwent a high anterior resection with an open approach to ensure proper removal of all abnormal tissue. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request. During the laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was found to be adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind-ending tube emerged from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon, which was marked for pathological identification. The patient had an uneventful recovery and reports a good quality of life following surgery. The patient expressed a desire for a permanent colostomy.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient did not express any need for further follow-up appointments at this time but was advised to contact the office with any further concerns or questions.
