**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:31:50 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Breast cancer (diagnosed two months ago)  
- **Recent Treatment:** Partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Intermittent abdominal pain  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a dull ache in the abdomen that comes and goes.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- A diffuse soft mass was palpated in the abdomen, slightly tender with unclear margins.  

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- **Abdominal CT Scan:** Revealed a giant multi-lobulated mass measuring 26Ã—12 cm adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The origin of the mass could not be determined by CT.  
- **Gastrofiberscopic Examination:** Showed a large bulging lesion with intact overlying mucosa on the posterior wall and lesser curvature side of the stomach.  
- **Blood Laboratory Data:** All values within normal ranges.  

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- **Procedure:** Exploratory laparotomy  
- **Findings:** A large multi-cystic mass originating from the lesser omentum of the stomach. A portion of the mass adhered to the omentum but was easily dissected. The lesser omentum, including the right and left gastric vessels and the vagus nerves, was fully involved in the mass.  
- **Surgical Decision:** Performed a distal gastrectomy with mass excision for curative resection. Mobilized the stomach and the mass, resected the right and left gastric vessels and the duodenum. Due to involvement of the trunk of both vagus nerves near the abdominal esophagogastric junction, a truncal vagotomy and dissection of the lesser omentum from the upper portion of the lesser was performed.  

**Postoperative Plan:**  
The patient will remain in the hospital for a few days for observation and recovery. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress.  

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the findings and the surgical procedure. The importance of follow-up appointments for monitoring recovery was emphasized.
