They both describe the case of a 48-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a large intraabdominal cystic mass and had a history of breast cancer diagnosed two months prior. Both notes detail the patient's recent partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and her chief complaint of intermittent abdominal pain. The physical examination findings, diagnostic studies, and surgical intervention details are consistent across both notes. The postoperative plan and patient education are also aligned, emphasizing the importance of follow-up appointments. Overall, the content and structure of the notes are closely matched."}}
