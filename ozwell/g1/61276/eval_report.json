They cover the patient's history, examination findings, investigations, and current status. Both notes mention the initial differential diagnosis of viral arthritis or irritable hip, the MRI findings of myositis and osteomyelitis, and the patient's improvement over time. The main difference is in the level of detail and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and formatted as a medical record."}}
