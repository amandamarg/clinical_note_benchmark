**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Sarah  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Lethargy and feeling unwell for the past two days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Sarah, a non-smoker and non-drinker, presents with severe, continuous pain in the right upper limb accompanied by weakness. She has experienced three episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. Her GP treated her with paracetamol for flu-like symptoms for three days. On the morning of admission, she noticed swelling of the lips and tongue and felt short of breath. The ambulance staff administered intramuscular adrenaline for a threatened airway. Upon admission, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.9Â°C, agitated, restless, and incontinent. Three hours later, she developed facial swelling, but the skin remained intact without erythema, rash, or blisters.

**Physical Examination:**  
- **General:** Febrile, agitated, restless, incontinent.
- **HEENT:** Oedematous tongue, pharynx, and buccal mucosa. No detectable septic focus. No neck stiffness or localizing neurological signs. GCS was 14. No local rise of temperature or tenderness in the head or neck. Soft tissue palpation of the head and neck was normal with no localized tenderness, palpable lymph nodes, or surgical emphysema.
- **Respiratory:** Equal air entry on both sides with diffusely scattered rhonchi.
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal.
- **Abdomen:** Localized tenderness in the left iliac fossa.
- **Pelvic and Perineal:** Normal as per gynecologist's examination.
- **Right Upper Limb:** No signs of cellulitis, erythema, or blisters. Soft tissue palpation was non-tender, with no signs of grimacing or withdrawal. Consistency was soft with no signs of compartment syndrome. Active movements at the shoulder were normal.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction or possible anaphylaxis, given the swelling of the lips and tongue and the administration of adrenaline. The cause of the right upper limb pain and weakness, as well as the gastrointestinal symptoms, requires further investigation. Additional tests will be conducted to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms.
