Both notes mention her being a non-smoker and non-drinker, her treatment with paracetamol for flu-like symptoms, and the administration of adrenaline for a threatened airway. They also describe her physical examination findings, including fever, agitation, and facial swelling, as well as the absence of erythema, rash, or blisters. The notes detail the medical assessments and plans, including the consideration of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis and the need for further investigation. Overall, the notes are very similar, with the second note being a more concise summary of the first."}}
