**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:38:55 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Persistent vomiting for several days.  
- **Medical History:** Dyslipidemia.  

**Presenting Symptoms:**  
- Vomiting almost every hour.  
- Distended stomach with mild abdominal pain.  
- Pale face and weak radial artery.  

**Vital Signs:**  
- Blood Pressure on arrival: 62/37 mm Hg.  

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- Hemoglobin level on admission: 12.4 g/dL.  

**Interventions and Procedures:**  
- Patient admitted to critical care center.  
- Venous sheath inserted in left femoral vein.  
- Infusion of 1000 mL crystalloid fluid initiated.  
- Enhanced computed tomography scan performed, revealing ruptured PDA aneurysm and celiac axis stenosis.  
- Decision made to perform transarterial embolization as endovascular treatment.  
- Patient prepared for oral intubation and transfer to emergency angiography room.  

**Complications:**  
- Sudden drop in blood pressure leading to hemodynamic shock.  
- Hemoglobin level dropped to 7.3 g/dL.  
- Difficulty securing right femoral artery due to obesity, weak pulse, and collapsed artery from hemorrhagic shock.  
- Subcutaneous hematoma developed after several attempts to puncture the artery, with suspected local arterial dissection.  

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- Switched to surgical treatment.  
- Surgical exposure of left femoral artery performed to insert aortic balloon occlusion catheter.  
- Celiac artery arteriography conducted to confirm point of rupture.  
- Aortic balloon position confirmed using fluoroscopy and balloon inflation.  

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring and supportive care in critical care setting.  
- Further evaluation and management of ruptured PDA aneurysm and celiac axis stenosis.
