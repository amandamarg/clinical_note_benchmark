Both notes detail the patient's initial presentation, vital signs, laboratory findings, and the interventions and procedures performed, including the decision to switch from transarterial embolization to surgical treatment due to complications. The notes also mention the use of an aortic balloon occlusion catheter and the subsequent surgical intervention. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the entire medical case, including the patient's progress and follow-up, while the second note is a clinical summary focusing on the initial presentation and immediate interventions."}}
