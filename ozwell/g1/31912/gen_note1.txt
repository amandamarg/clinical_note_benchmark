**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:38:42 AM  

**Patient Presentation:**  
The patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of persistent vomiting for several days, occurring almost every hour. The patient reported a history of dyslipidemia and described mild abdominal pain with a distended stomach. Upon arrival, the patient's blood pressure was recorded at 62/37 mm Hg, and the patient appeared pale with a weak radial artery pulse.

**Initial Assessment and Treatment:**  
The patient was admitted to the critical care center due to the severity of the condition. Initial hemoglobin level was 12.4 g/dL. A venous sheath was inserted in the left femoral vein, and an infusion of 1000 mL crystalloid fluid was initiated. Following fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure improved, allowing for further diagnostic evaluation.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
An enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a ruptured PDA aneurysm and celiac axis stenosis.

**Planned Intervention:**  
The decision was made to perform transarterial embolization as an endovascular treatment. The patient was prepared for oral intubation and transfer to the emergency angiography room.

**Complications and Surgical Intervention:**  
Prior to the procedure, the patient's blood pressure suddenly dropped, leading to hemodynamic shock, and the hemoglobin level decreased to 7.3 g/dL. Due to the patient's obesity, securing the right femoral artery was challenging, with a weak pulse and collapsed artery from hemorrhagic shock. Multiple attempts to puncture the artery resulted in a subcutaneous hematoma and suspected local arterial dissection, necessitating a switch to surgical treatment.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
Surgical exposure of the left femoral artery was performed to insert an aortic balloon occlusion catheter. Celiac artery arteriography was conducted to confirm the rupture point before balloon catheter insertion. The position of the aortic balloon was confirmed using fluoroscopy, followed by inflation of the balloon.

**Plan:**  
The patient will continue to be monitored closely in the critical care setting, with further interventions as necessary based on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to treatment.
