**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:38:53 AM  

**Patient Presentation:**  
The patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of persistent vomiting for several days, occurring almost every hour. The patient reported a history of dyslipidemia and described mild abdominal pain with a distended stomach. Upon arrival, the patient's blood pressure was recorded at 62/37 mm Hg, and the patient appeared pale with a weak radial artery pulse. Initial hemoglobin level was 12.4 g/dL.

**Interventions and Findings:**  
The patient was admitted to the critical care center. A venous sheath was inserted in the left femoral vein, and an infusion of 1000 mL crystalloid fluid was initiated. Following stabilization of blood pressure, an enhanced computed tomography scan was performed, revealing a ruptured PDA aneurysm and celiac axis stenosis. The decision was made to proceed with transarterial embolization as an endovascular treatment. The patient was prepared for oral intubation and transfer to the emergency angiography room.

**Complications:**  
The patient's condition deteriorated with a sudden drop in blood pressure, leading to hemodynamic shock. Hemoglobin level decreased to 7.3 g/dL. Due to the patient's obesity, securing the right femoral artery was challenging, with a weak pulse and collapsed artery from hemorrhagic shock. Multiple attempts to puncture the artery resulted in a subcutaneous hematoma, and local arterial dissection was suspected.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The treatment plan was adjusted to surgical intervention. Surgical exposure of the left femoral artery was performed to insert an aortic balloon occlusion catheter. Celiac artery arteriography was conducted to confirm the rupture point before balloon catheter insertion. The position of the aortic balloon was confirmed using fluoroscopy, followed by inflation of the balloon.

**Plan:**  
The patient will continue to be monitored closely in the critical care setting, with further interventions as necessary based on the patient's response to the current treatment plan.
