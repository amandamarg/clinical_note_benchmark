**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. (Patient's Name)

**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Presenting Complaint:** The patient presented to the accident and emergency department after sustaining a fall, resulting in pain and reduced range of movement in the left shoulder.

**Past Medical History:**
- Hypertension
- Atrial fibrillation (on aspirin 75 mg once a day)
- Thyroidectomy in 2000 for hyperthyroidism

**Drug Allergies:** None

**Examination Findings:**
- Bruised and painful left arm upon movement
- Distal neurovascular status of the affected limb was normal with no deficit detected

**Investigations:**
- Plain film radiographs of the left shoulder demonstrated a minimally displaced and impacted fracture of the proximal humerus.

**Management:**
- After discussion with the orthopaedic registrar on call, the patient was placed in a collar and cuff and sent home to attend the next available fracture clinic.
- Upon review in the fracture clinic, swelling and erythema were noted on the left side of the neck in the distribution of the external jugular vein, attributed to the collar and cuff being applied too tightly.
- Referred to the on-call ENT registrar, who diagnosed thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein. No history of further thrombotic events.
- Started on antibiotics (flucloxacillin 500 mg four times a day for 5 days) for potential developing cellulitis and placed in a better fitting sling.
- Fracture deemed suitable for nonsurgical management with regular clinical and radiological follow-up.
- As the patient was only on holiday in the region, further follow-up was arranged for two weeks in the local hospital.

**Subsequent Events:**
- Two days later, the patient represented to the accident and emergency department with pain and gross pitting oedema in the left arm.
- A Doppler scan demonstrated near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins consistent with a deep vein thrombosis.
- The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy.

**Plan:**
- Follow-up arranged in a few weeks. The patient was advised to contact the clinic with any questions or concerns.
