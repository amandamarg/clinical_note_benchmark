Both describe a 54-year-old woman with a history of a large goiter and moderate liver function abnormalities, specifically noting ALT levels three times the normal range. They both mention her referral to address multiple dietary supplement use, the absence of other apparent causes for liver dysfunction, and her normal body weight and lifestyle factors. Both notes highlight her history of increasing dietary supplement use, her concerns about polypharmacy, and the decision to cease all supplements except for calcium, vitamin D, and a multivitamin. They also discuss her plan to increase dietary intake of certain nutrients, practice mind-body techniques, and the offer of counseling for anxiety management. The follow-up plan to monitor liver function and encourage dietary and lifestyle modifications is also consistent in both notes."}}
