Both describe the patient's experience of pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of the knee following a unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) with a mobile bearing. They mention the initial uneventful recovery, the onset of symptoms around 9 months post-surgery, and the patient's visits to a community hospital where it was assessed as a likely hamstring strain. Both notes detail the radiographic findings of posterior dislocation of the polyethylene insert and the clinical examination results, including the greater varus alignment and tenderness in specific areas. The surgical findings of severe abrasion and metallosis, as well as the encapsulation of the polyethylene insert, are also noted in both. The plan for revision surgery and follow-up with physical therapy is consistent across both notes."}}
