**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling in the posterior aspect of the knee, which began approximately 9 months post-surgery. The patient underwent an uncomplicated unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) with a mobile bearing. Initial recovery was uneventful, but the patient has since developed a constant background ache with activity-related pain and increased stiffness over the last month. The patient denies any specific trauma but recalls tripping around the time symptoms began. The main area of discomfort is around the medial hamstring tendons. The patient has visited a community hospital multiple times, where it was assessed as a likely hamstring strain and was discharged with analgesia. There was no discussion with the arthroplasty department.

**Objective:**  
Radiographs indicate posterior dislocation of the polyethylene insert toward the popliteal fossa, into soft tissues adjacent to the neurovascular bundle, with direct contact of metal components. Clinical examination reveals a moderately swollen knee with minimal effusion, greater varus alignment at the knee compared to the other leg, and a range of motion of 10–125° with no major instability. The varus is not fully correctable. There is moderate tenderness in the medial proximal tibia and distal femur, as well as tenderness and focal swelling in the medial aspect of the popliteal fossa and medial hamstring tendon area.

**Assessment:**  
The surgical exploration revealed severe abrasion of both femoral and tibial components, with severe metallosis within the synovium. The polyethylene insert was encapsulated in thick fibrous tissue in the posterior soft tissues.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a revision surgery to correct the problem. Post-surgery, the patient will need to follow up with physical therapy to aid in recovery.

**Follow-up:**  
The revision surgery will be scheduled, and the patient will be seen soon for further management.
