Both provide a detailed account of the patient's medical history, the reason for hospitalization, recent medical history, and the course of events during hospitalization. They both mention the patient's persistent atrial fibrillation, atrial hypertension, obstructive lung disease, and previous cancer treatments. They also describe the elevated INR levels, the treatment with fluconazole and pantoprazole, and the subsequent increase in INR leading to hospitalization. Both notes detail the events on the third day of hospitalization, including the prescription and discontinuation of metoprolol, the development of bradycardia and hypotension, and the initiation of isoprenaline infusion. The suspected interaction between verapamil and metoprolol is also highlighted in both notes."}}
