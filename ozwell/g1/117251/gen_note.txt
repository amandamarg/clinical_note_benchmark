**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Recent onset of left knee pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a deep-seated pain within the left knee with restriction of movements for the last 4 weeks. There is no recent history of fall or trauma to the left knee.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Palpation reveals pieces of wires, but no patella or joint line tenderness.  
- No effusion noted.  
- Cruciate and collateral ligaments are intact.  
- No neurovascular deficit.  
- Knee extension power is normal.  
- Range of motion of the knee is painfully restricted.

**Radiographic Findings:**  
Radiographs show a united fracture patella with broken cerclage wire. The inferio-medial segment of the broken cerclage wire has migrated into the posterior compartment of the knee joint and is hooked anteriorly at the base of the anterior cruciate ligament.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Diagnosis: Migrated broken cerclage wire in the left knee.  
- Recommended surgical intervention for removal of the patella wires.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Pre-surgery fluoroscopic examination indicated the posterior part of the wire had shifted its position, with the anterior part still hooked with the anterior cruciate ligament.  
- Arthroscopic examination during surgery revealed a migrated piece of wire embedded at the base of the anterior cruciate ligament, extending toward the posterior compartment of the knee through the medial side of the notch, which was successfully removed.  
- Intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed no remaining piece of wire in the posterior compartment of the knee.  
- The rest of the broken wires were removed via a midline anterior knee incision along the old incision.

**Outcome:**  
The surgery was successful. The patient is advised to follow up in a week to monitor progress.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess recovery and ensure proper healing.
