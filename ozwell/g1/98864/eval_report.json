They both describe the medical history and current condition of an 11-year-old boy who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury from a fall at age 4, leading to the discovery of an extensive optic glioma. Both notes detail the progression of the tumor, complications with VP shunt placement due to high protein CSF, and the eventual placement of a VG shunt. They also mention the patient's poor neurological status and the decision by the pediatric neuro-oncology tumor board that no further treatment could be offered. The notes conclude with the challenges in managing the patient's condition due to the tumor and previous surgical interventions."}}
