Both notes mention the patient's limited motion in the ankle and toes, sensory reduction in the foot, and the development of a fluid-filled, erythematous mass with a draining sinus. They also describe the radiographic findings of a widespread radiopaque mass and the angiography findings of popliteal artery obstruction.
