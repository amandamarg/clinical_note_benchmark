They both mention the patient's chief complaint of patchy edema erythema on the left side of the head, which has expanded and spread to the left face. Both notes detail the dermatological examination findings, including the dark red or purplish red infiltrating patches, exudation, scabs, and mild edema around the eyes. They also include the results of the CT scans and the pathological assay, highlighting the atrophy, widened subdural space, fiber proliferation in the lung, gallstone, aortic sclerosis, and possible cysts. The assessment and plan sections in both notes focus on the skin condition being due to inflammation and blood vessel formation, with recommendations for regular check-ups and monitoring. The main difference is the date and time of the notes, with the first note being from 2019 and the second from 2025."}}
