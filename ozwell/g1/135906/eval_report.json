Both describe the case of a 39-year-old female with recurrent painless swelling in the left thigh, a history of surgeries for removal, and a diagnosis of Mazabraud's syndrome. They detail the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, investigations, diagnosis, management plan, surgical findings, and follow-up. The main difference is the format and some specific details, but the core information is consistent across both notes."}}
