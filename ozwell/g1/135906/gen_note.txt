**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Recurrent swelling in the left thigh  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with recurrent swelling in the left thigh, initially noticed in 2001. The swelling was painless and gradually increased in size. The patient underwent surgical removal of the swelling twice, in 2005 and 2009. Post-surgery, the patient was asymptomatic for 2 years after the first surgery and 3 years after the second surgery. Currently, the patient reports a new swelling over the left distal thigh, which is increasing in size and causing discomfort.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Large, oval-shaped swelling measuring approximately 8 cm × 4 cm on the medial aspect of the left distal thigh.  
- Painless with a healed scar over the left medial thigh.  
- Quadriceps wasting noted.

**Investigations:**  
- Radiographs of the thigh showed fibrous dysplasia.  
- MRI of the whole thigh revealed two additional soft tissue masses in the left mid-thigh and inguinal region.  
- Biopsy report suggested myxoma.

**Diagnosis:**  
Clinical diagnosis of Mazabraud's syndrome.

**Management Plan:**  
The patient opted for the excision of the large distal thigh swelling, while the two small, asymptomatic swellings are to be managed conservatively. After informed consent, the patient underwent wide excision of the distal thigh swelling through the previous skin incision.

**Surgical Findings:**  
- The excised mass was intramuscular, located within the vastus medialis.  
- It was a single, globular, pale white, encapsulated nodular mass measuring 8 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm and weighed approximately 88 g.

**Histopathological Examination:**  
The examination confirmed the mass as an intramuscular myxoma with no necrotic areas or atypical features.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks.
