They both describe the case of a 66-year-old man who suffered an anterior shoulder dislocation after a ski fall, leading to complications including a hematoma, axillary artery disruption, and bilateral pulmonary embolism. Both notes detail the initial unsuccessful reduction attempts, the need for general anesthesia, the subsequent vascular and surgical interventions, and the patient's postoperative course, including the use of anticoagulant therapy and the functional outcome related to distal brachial plexus stunning. The information is consistent across both notes, with no significant differences in the details provided."}}
