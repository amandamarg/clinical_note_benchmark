**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:17:52 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Transient loss of consciousness while driving  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient experienced a transient loss of consciousness while driving, prompting a visit to the A&E. Initial investigations included a chest X-ray, which revealed a large shadow in the neck. Further imaging with a CT scan identified a saccular aneurysm in the aortic arch. This finding was confirmed by a Transthoracic echocardiogram and an MR scan. The aneurysm was noted to cause displacement of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, with the left common carotid artery displaced anteriorly and to the right, and the left subclavian artery displaced well down and into the left chest. There was also significant tortuosity and redundancy of the aorta between the two vessels, with the aorta and aneurysm extending well into the neck. A coronary angiogram was performed and returned normal results.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient underwent a median sternotomy, which revealed a 9 cm Ã— 11 cm aortic arch aneurysm causing compression, deviation, and distortion of several adjacent structures. The trachea was severely compressed with deviation to the right. The aneurysm formed a posterior relation with the ascending aorta and the left common carotid artery, displacing them both anteriorly.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be closely monitored with follow-up appointments scheduled to assess the condition and any potential changes. The patient has been advised to return if any new symptoms or concerns arise.
