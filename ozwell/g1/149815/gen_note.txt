**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital two days ago following a fall from a bridge, resulting in a severe hip injury. Upon admission, the patient reported significant pain in the hip and was experiencing bleeding.

**Objective:**  
Initial X-ray findings indicated a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis. The patient also presented with confirmed hematuria, suggesting a possible anterior dislocation of the femoral head. A CT scan was not available at the time. A Foley catheter was introduced into the urinary bladder, and antibiotics were administered.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- **Day 1:** Surgery was performed using a lateral approach to the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was not located in the hip but was found in the pelvis and could not be extracted. A 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was implanted. Post-surgery, the femoral head was replaced, and the fractured femoral head remained as a loose fragment in the pelvis.
  
- **Day 3:** The urologist extracted the femoral head via a new abdominal approach (Gibson) with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels. Post-extraction, the patient experienced hip pain, loss of mobility, and swelling at the hip wound. Several punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear liquid, which was analyzed and found to have density and elements similar to urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound.

- **Urological Evaluation:** Repeated evaluations using urography and endoscopic techniques revealed a fistula injury of the ipsilateral ureter. An internal drainage of the ureter was introduced and will remain in situ for three months.

- **Current Status:** The Moore prosthesis was extracted, and the hip was debrided. The patient is being prepared for the next surgery. Continuous monitoring of the patient's condition will be conducted to ensure recovery, and follow-up requirements will be communicated.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely, and updates on follow-up requirements will be provided to ensure a smooth recovery process.
