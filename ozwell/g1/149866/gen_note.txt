**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Inability to walk on both lower limbs for the past three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports the onset of pain in the right groin while walking approximately three months ago, which led to limping and swaying. The patient was unable to bear weight on the right lower limb. A week later, similar pain developed in the left groin, resulting in the inability to bear weight on either lower limb, leading to the patient being bedridden since then. The patient denies any other symptoms besides the pain in the groins and the inability to walk.

**Clinical Findings and Diagnosis:**  
The patient presents with a coxa vara deformity of the bilateral hips and a possibility of bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the femur neck. Imaging studies revealed polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur and bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur. Additional imaging showed fibrous dysplastic lesions in the shaft of the left tibia. MRI of the bilateral hip region indicated fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur shaft and a sub-capital fracture of the femur neck, without evidence of avascular necrosis of the femur head. Blood and serum biochemical tests, including hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels, and hormonal studies, were all within normal limits.

**Plan and Procedure:**  
The treatment plan involves correcting the deformity to realign the head, neck, and shaft, achieving valgus at the neck-shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture to increase the chances of union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur. This will be done in one stage, each side at a time. On the right side, an oblique osteotomy was performed from just distal to the greater trochanter. This procedure aims to correct the deformity and realign the bones to allow the patient to walk again. The patient will need to return for follow-up appointments to monitor progress and ensure proper healing.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to attend follow-up appointments for monitoring and further management.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient had no further questions or concerns at this time.
