Both describe the case of a 16-year-old female patient with an inability to walk due to pain in the groin and bilateral hip deformities. They detail the history of present illness, clinical findings, diagnosis, and treatment plan involving surgical correction of the deformity. Both notes mention the imaging findings of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity, and non-union of the femur neck fracture. They also describe the surgical procedures performed and the follow-up plan. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's signature and patient's questions in the clinical note."}}
