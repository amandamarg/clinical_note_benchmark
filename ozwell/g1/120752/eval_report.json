Both describe a case involving a 73-year-old male patient from the neurosurgery department who experienced vomiting after taking medication on March 9, 2015. They both mention that the patient was taking six drugs related to vomiting, with Tramadol HCI identified as the most likely cause according to a decision tree model. The physician accepted the recommendation to change the prescription to Tramadol HCI, and later reported a probable causality between the vomiting and Tramadol HCI. The notes also discuss the importance of the medical department in identifying causative drugs for adverse events and mention the limited dataset available for similar patients."}}
