Both notes mention the discovery of a 1.5 cm, saccular, thin-walled aneurysm near the hilum of the kidney, which led to the kidney not being used for transplantation. They also discuss the histopathological findings of cystic medial degeneration and the potential aetiology related to arterial fibrodysplasia. Additionally, both notes emphasize the importance of raising awareness about this condition among retrieval and transplant teams. The main difference is that the clinical note includes specific details about a patient's follow-up after transplant surgery, while the other note is more focused on the case report and its implications for medical practice."}}
