**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient reports having trouble breathing and experiencing worsening shortness of breath.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has experienced multiple myocardial infarctions. The patient has had two coronary stents placed in 2003 and two additional stents placed just prior to admission. The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. In the emergency department, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate was noted, with a heart rate of 140. The patient was started on a diltiazem infusion and admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. A repeat echocardiogram several days later showed a progressive worsening of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 18%. The patient was started on inotropic support and underwent placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to assist with hemodynamic stability. Approximately 24 hours later, the patient experienced an episode of melena associated with a drop in hemoglobin from 10.1 to 7.7 and was started on a proton pump inhibitor infusion. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed erythema and erosions in the gastric fundus compatible with gastritis, as well as grade 1 reflux esophagitis, but no evidence of active bleeding. A Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was negative. The patient underwent a colonoscopy after hemodynamic stabilization for further evaluation of melena and pretransplant screen, which was positive for abnormal vascularity, congestion, nodularity, erosions, erythema, and ulceration in the cecum and ascending colon suggestive of ischemic colitis, later confirmed by biopsy. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to evaluate the celiac and mesenteric vasculature, showing no significant narrowing of either vessel; however, the inferior metallic marker of the IABP was found to be inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. The findings were consistent with ischemic colitis of the cecum and ascending colon as visualized on the colonoscopy from occlusion caused by the IABP. The IABP was repositioned.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
- Follow up on the patient's response to the repositioning of the IABP.
- Continue proton pump inhibitor infusion and monitor for any further gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Keep the patient informed of any follow-up requirements and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
