Both describe a 30-year-old female Turkish patient who experienced dissatisfaction with the appearance of her anterior teeth following a dentoalveolar trauma and surgical operation in 2004. They both mention the patient's initial consultation with a plastic surgeon, the clinical and radiographic examinations revealing vestibulary positioned maxillary incisors, oblique fractures, and a misplacement of the maxillary segment. Both notes discuss the patient's preference to avoid further surgical operations and the proposed conservative treatment plan involving porcelain laminate veneers, an all ceramic crown, and a metal-ceramic fixed partial denture. The need for endodontic treatment for the non-vital maxillary right central incisor and first premolar is also mentioned in both notes."}}
