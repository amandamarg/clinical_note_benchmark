**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient was admitted to the hospital with fresh hemorrhagic stool. A colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, but the bleeding site was not clear in the visible range of the stomach, duodenum, and colon.

**Hospital Course:**
- On the second day, a capsule endoscopy was conducted, which detected bleeding from the small intestine. The patient subsequently developed shock due to massive bleeding and underwent emergency transcatheter arterial embolization.
- The patient has a history of surgery for anal atresia and small bowel stoma as a neonate and requires hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure with bilateral kidney malformations.
- Prior to the transcatheter arterial embolization, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed. The results showed normal anatomy of the left common iliac artery, but a defect in the right external iliac artery. Blood from the right common iliac artery flowed directly into a traveling vessel, the internal iliac artery, then descended at an acute angle to the pelvic floor, and rose to flow into the femoral artery.
- The catheter was inserted from the left femoral artery and selectively advanced to the superior mesenteric artery, identified as the responsible vessel for gastrointestinal bleeding. However, angiography did not show clear extravasation from either branch of the superior mesenteric artery.
- On the 8th day, small intestinal endoscopy was attempted, but advancement was impossible due to strong small intestinal adhesion. The patient experienced no further massive bleeding and was discharged home on the 20th day after receiving a red blood cell transfusion.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient was later hospitalized again for small intestinal resection. During surgery, 30 cm of the adhered small intestine was resected, and small intestinal endoscopy was performed through the small bowel stump. Two diverticula were found on the oral side, but no obvious bleeding was detected. A submucosal cystic lesion was noted.

**Plan:**
- The patient will be referred to a specialist for further treatment. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for one week later.
