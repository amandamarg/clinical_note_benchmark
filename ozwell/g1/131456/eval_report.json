They both detail the patient's history of a presumed keloid scar following a motor vehicle accident, the subsequent development of the mass, and the recent changes in the mass's size and characteristics. Both notes include information about the physical examination, imaging findings, and the procedure of a wide excisional biopsy. The main difference is that the first note includes more detailed histological examination results and a treatment plan involving a multidisciplinary approach with radiation oncology, while the second note mentions that histological examination results are pending and suggests monitoring and potential referral to oncology."}}
