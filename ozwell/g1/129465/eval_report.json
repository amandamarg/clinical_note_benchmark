Both notes mention the patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, the previous treatment for breast cancer, and the recent discovery of a hepatic lesion and a pancreatic lesion. They both describe the patient's decision to undergo laparotomy, the findings during the procedure, and the outcome of the surgery. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical history and treatment."}}
