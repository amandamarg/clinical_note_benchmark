**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [Patient's MRN]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. She has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Seven years ago, she was treated for invasive ductal breast cancer with a lumpectomy of the left breast, axillary lymph node dissection, radiation therapy, and seven cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She was also prescribed Anastrozole for 5 years. The patient has been having regular annual follow-ups for 5 years with chest and abdominal computed tomography scanning, with no signs of recurrence or metastatic disease until recently.

**Objective:**  
- **Recent Findings:** Abdominal CT revealed a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII measuring 7 cm in diameter and a 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas.  
- **Symptoms:** Mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region; no other symptoms or signs of abdominal mass.  
- **Laboratory Results:** Tumor markers AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, and CEA were all within normal limits. Biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient underwent oncologic consultation, and both lesions were considered resectable. There was controversy regarding whether the lesions were metastatic or second primary malignancies. The patient rejected CT-guided percutaneous biopsies or laparoscopic biopsies due to the risk of possible complications and cancer spillage.

**Plan:**  
The patient decided to undergo laparotomy, open rapid biopsy, and excision of the lesions in one procedure. During the procedure, after accessing the peritoneal cavity through an extended right subcostal incision, hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe were performed. A solid mass was recognized at hepatic segments VI and VII, and a rapid biopsy showed primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A second rapid biopsy from the lesion at the pancreatic tail showed chronic fibrosis without elements of malignancy. Resection of hepatic segments VI and VII was performed since intraoperative hepatic ultrasound confirmed that the mass was resectable with safe oncologic margins. Hepatic segmentectomy was achieved successfully.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will need to return for follow-up in a few weeks to assess healing and check for any other issues.
