Both notes describe the same clinical case of a 32-year-old woman with primary infertility due to her husband's asthenozoospermia and teratospermia, who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection. They detail her post-procedure symptoms, diagnosis of OHSS with right ovarian torsion, the emergency surgical intervention, and the positive outcome of a successful pregnancy following a frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The main content and sequence of events are consistent across both notes."}}
