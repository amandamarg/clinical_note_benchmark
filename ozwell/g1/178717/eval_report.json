Both describe the patient's history of presenting with right arm pain and swelling, the diagnosis of primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis, and the subsequent treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. They both mention the complications of thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression, the patient's intractable pain, and the use of opioid therapy. The notes also detail the diagnostic brachial plexus block and the patient's decision to proceed with a chemical neurolytic brachial plexus block. The main difference is that the second note includes a family discussion about the patient's passing, which is not present in the first note."}}
