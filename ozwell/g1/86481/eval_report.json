They both describe the case of a six and a half-year-old boy with an aneurysmal bone cyst in the right forearm. Both notes detail the history of the present illness, including the initial mild pain that worsened over time, leading to medical consultation. They describe the diagnostic studies performed, including X-rays, MRI, and biopsy, which confirmed the presence of the cyst. The assessment in both notes identifies the expansile lesion with thin cortices, making curettage unfeasible. The plan in both notes involves surgical intervention with options for reconstruction, including using the patient's own fibula, a cadaveric allograft, or an allogenic allograft from the mother. The parents' reluctance to use the banked allograft is noted, and further discussion with the family is planned to finalize the treatment. Both notes emphasize the need for follow-up and consultation with the family to determine the best course of action."}}
