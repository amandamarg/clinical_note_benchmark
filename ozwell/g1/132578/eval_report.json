Both describe the case of a 6-month-old male with a swelling on the hypothenar eminence of the left hand, which was painless and gradually increasing in size. They both mention the habit of the baby hitting his left hand on objects, the pulsatile nature of the swelling, and the absence of motor deficits. The diagnosis of an aneurysmal swelling likely arising from the ulnar artery or palmar arch is consistent in both notes. The investigation with an arterial duplex and the decision to proceed with surgical excision due to financial and age-related limitations are also mentioned in both. The surgical procedure involving the excision of the aneurysm and repair with a reverse cephalic vein graft is detailed in both notes, along with the postoperative outcome of palpable pulses and intact motor movement. The follow-up advice is also similar, with a focus on monitoring for any future concerns."}}
