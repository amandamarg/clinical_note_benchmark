**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** 6-month-old male

**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Presenting Complaint:** Swelling on the hypothenar eminence of the left hand, noticed by parents.

**History of Presenting Complaint:** The swelling has been present for 2 months and has been gradually increasing in size. The parents reported no unusual crying or pain, indicating that the swelling is painless. The mother mentioned that the baby has a habit of hitting his left hand on the table while having food and on other objects.

**Examination Findings:** 
- The swelling was pulsatile on palpation.
- No motor deficits were observed in the left hand.

**Diagnosis:** Based on the clinical history and examination, an aneurysmal swelling was confirmed, most likely arising from the ulnar artery or the palmar arch due to its location.

**Investigations:** An arterial duplex confirmed the presence of an aneurysmal sac. However, a detailed anatomical description was not possible due to the compromised examination because of the child's age. No further investigations were conducted due to financial limitations and the child's very young age.

**Treatment:** Surgical excision was performed. Intraoperatively, the aneurysmal swelling involved the ulnar artery from below the wrist and at the distal forearm, involving the superficial palmar arch distally and taking the digital blood supply of the little finger and the ring finger with it. The aneurysm was excised and repaired with an interposition reverse cephalic vein graft from the forearm of the same side. A segment of the Y-shaped cephalic vein with a tributary was taken from the distal forearm of the same side. The proximal end of the reverse cephalic vein was anastomosed to the distal end of the ulnar artery, and the two distal ends of the reverse cephalic vein in a Y-shape fashion were anastomosed, one at the superficial.

**Follow-up:** The patient and parents were advised to monitor for any concerns or questions in the future.
