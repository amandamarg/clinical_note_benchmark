Both notes describe the case of a 29-year-old Albanian man who was admitted to the Surgical Department after being shot in the back. They outline the initial assessment, surgical exploration, post-surgery developments, imaging findings, vascular surgery consultation, and the second surgery performed. The second note includes more specific details about the procedures and findings, such as the use of a Fogarty catheter for embolectomy and the development of compartment syndrome.
