**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. Smith  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Chief Complaint:** Skin condition on the left pre-auricular area.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. Smith was referred to our clinic for evaluation and management of a confirmed squamous cell carcinoma on the left pre-auricular area, diagnosed through an incisional biopsy. The patient reported occasional bleeding, discharge, and repeated ulceration of the lesion.

**Preoperative Evaluation:**  
A computed tomography scan of the head and neck region was performed, showing no evidence of invasion.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
A wide excision of the tumor was performed, achieving a safe margin of depth without injury to the parotid gland, despite the tumor bed's proximity to the parotid gland fascia. The parotid gland fascia was preserved, although micro-injuries could not be completely ruled out. The resulting skin defect was covered with a 5Ã—6 cm full-thickness skin graft from the left inguinal area, and a compression dressing with a tie-over suture was applied to maintain the graft.

**Postoperative Course:**  
On the fifth postoperative day, exudate was noted from the base of the skin graft through the slit incision site, with wet dressing materials and increased discharge during meals. The discharge volume was approximately 50 mL, with an amylase level of 200,000 unit/L, confirming it as salivary discharge. The patient was diagnosed with a sialo-cutaneous fistula.

**Treatment:**  
Due to concerns of graft failure from increased sialorrhea not controlled by conventional compression dressings, a botulinum toxin type A injection was administered. Using a tuberculin syringe, 25 IU of the toxin was injected transcutaneously at a point 0.5 cm above the fistula site at the surgical incision line, and another 25 IU injection was administered 0.5 cm anterior to that point. The injections targeted only the superficial parotid gland to avoid post-injection facial nerve paralysis.

**Outcome:**  
The discharge from the sialo-cutaneous fistula was significantly reduced after the second day of injection. The patient fully recovered within a week without complications such as graft shearing or failure.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was advised to monitor for any changes or concerns and to contact the clinic if needed.

**Plan:**  
No further immediate interventions are required. Continue routine follow-up and monitor for any recurrence or complications.
