**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:27:17 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Symptoms:** Asymptomatic  
- **Physical Exam:** Strictly normal  

**History:**  
The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound following a routine checkup blood test that showed slightly elevated liver enzymes with no other lab abnormalities. The ultrasound revealed a right adrenal lesion measuring 9 cm in diameter. An abdominal MRI was subsequently performed, revealing a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm originating from the right adrenal gland. An endocrinological evaluation showed normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hypersecretion of catecholamines. An adrenal scan indicated a well-encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications, without local invasion.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
The decision was made to proceed with a right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia after the insertion of central and arterial lines, with the patient in the left decubitus position. Five trocars were inserted:  
- A 12-mm port at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle above the umbilicus for the camera.  
- Two 11-mm subcostal ports, one in the midclavicular line and the other at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle.  
- A 5-mm subcostal trocar in the anterior axillary line for liver retraction.  
- A 5-mm trocar in the epigastrium for aspiration and irrigation.

After liver retraction, the peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised to expose the IVC just below its intrahepatic course. The duodenum, diverted by the mass, was mobilized. Dissection proceeded inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein. Special care was taken during the dissection of the mass, particularly at the medial aspect.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be monitored post-operatively and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and any further treatment needs.
