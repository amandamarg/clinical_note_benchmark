Both notes describe the patient's medical history, the discovery of the adrenal mass, the surgical procedure performed, and the post-operative plan. The details about the patient's symptoms, physical exam, imaging results, and surgical approach are consistent across both notes. The main difference lies in the presentation and slight variations in phrasing, but the content and information conveyed are the same."}}
