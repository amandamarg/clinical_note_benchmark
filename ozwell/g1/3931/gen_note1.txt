**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]  
- **Age:** [Patient's Age]  
- **Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports being asymptomatic with no physical exam abnormalities. The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound due to slightly elevated liver enzymes found during a routine blood test.  

**Objective:**  
- **Abdominal Ultrasound:** Revealed a right adrenal lesion of 9 cm diameter.  
- **Abdominal MRI:** Showed a soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass of 10 × 9 cm originating from the right adrenal gland.  
- **Endocrinological Evaluation:** Normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hypersecretion of catecholamines.  
- **Adrenal Scan:** Demonstrated a well-encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications, without local invasion.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a right adrenal mass with no evidence of local invasion or hormonal hypersecretion.  

**Plan:**  
- **Surgical Intervention:** Right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy was performed.  
  - **Procedure Details:**  
    - Surgery conducted under general anesthesia with central and arterial lines insertion.  
    - Patient positioned in left decubitus.  
    - Five trocars inserted:  
      - First 12-mm port at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle above the umbilicus for the camera.  
      - Two subcostal 11 mm ports: one in the midclavicular line and the other at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle.  
      - Fourth 5-mm subcostal trocar in the anterior axillary line for liver retraction.  
      - Fifth 5 mm trocar in the epigastrium for aspiration and irrigation.  
    - Liver retracted, peritoneum incised along the lateral aspect of the IVC to expose it below its intrahepatic course.  
    - Duodenum mobilized, dissection carried inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein.  
    - Careful dissection of the mass, particularly at the medial aspect.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored post-operatively and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and any further treatment needs.
