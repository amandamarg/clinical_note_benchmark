However, the first note concludes a diagnosis of low-grade osteosarcoma, while the second note states no malignancy was detected.\n\n5. **Assessment and Plan:** The first note details a diagnosis of primary osteosarcoma and subsequent surgical treatment, while the second note suggests the mass is non-malignant and requires monitoring.\n\nOverall, the notes are similar in describing the patient's condition and initial findings but differ significantly in the diagnosis and treatment plan."}}
