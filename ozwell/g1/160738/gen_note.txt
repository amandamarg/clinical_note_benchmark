**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:24:30 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Pain and swelling in the left angle of the mandible for the past 4 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports continuous pain and swelling in the left angle of the mandible, worsening with eating or opening the mouth. The patient had surgery 15 years ago for swelling at the same site but does not have the records.

**Examination:**  
- **Inspection:** Swelling observed in the left angle of the mandible.  
- **Palpation:** Firm to hard tender swelling extending from the left first molar to the third molar region, fixed to the underlying bone.  
- **Teeth:** No signs of mobility or resorption in the involved teeth.  
- **Paresthesia:** None reported in the area supplied by the inferior alveolar nerve.  
- **Mucosa:** Normal appearance with no secondary changes.

**Investigations:**  
- **OPG Test:** Showed scattered calcification superimposed over the left third molar and ramus region on the left side.  
- **CT Scan:** Revealed a well-encapsulated juxtacortical mass in the left angle of the mandible with areas of calcification. Erosion of the cortical bone in the third molar and anterior ramus region with some intramedullary extension. A well-defined swelling overlying the left mandibular body with calcified/ossified areas in the soft tissue.

**Procedure:**  
An incisional biopsy was performed, and the extrabony component of the mass was removed. The extraosseous mass was well encapsulated but fixed to the underlying bone, which was eroded in the third molar region where the mass was found infiltrating into bone and was not separable. The section of the specimen showed multiple irregular calcified masses.

**Histopathology:**  
H and E-stained section showed highly cellular areas of connective tissue with a lace-like pattern of neoplastic osteoid tissue. No malignancy was detected.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a mass in the left angle of the mandible causing pain and swelling. The mass is non-malignant but requires monitoring.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the situation.  
- Advise the patient to avoid foods that are hard to chew and maintain oral hygiene in the affected area.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the findings and the need for follow-up. Advised to contact the clinic if there are any concerns or questions.
