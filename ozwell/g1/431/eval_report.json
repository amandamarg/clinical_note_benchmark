Both describe a 56-year-old woman with a history of rectal bleeding, mucus passage, and a change in bowel habits over six months. They detail her medical history, including bladder exstrophy and multiple surgeries, and note the absence of other major co-morbidities or family history of colorectal disease. Both notes describe the colonoscopy findings of two large sessile polyps with dysplasia and the decision to opt for surgical resection due to the characteristics of the polyps and potential invasive disease. They also mention the patient's request for a permanent colostomy and her uneventful recovery with good quality of life post-surgery. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of a clinical note format in the second note."}}
