**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:48:49 AM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits for the past 6 months. They reported more frequent stools and the passage of mucus, but no abdominal pain. The patient has a significant medical history of bladder exstrophy with multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5, and recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood. There are no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy, and no family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
A colonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, each approximately 3 cm in size, with a type IV pit pattern and areas of irregularity suggestive of focally advanced disease. The polyps were adjacent to a diverticulum-like structure. Histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion. The mucosa around the diverticulum was atypical but not adenomatous. No other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps was found elsewhere in the colon.

**Assessment:**  
The characteristics of the polyps and difficult endoscopic access led to the decision for surgical intervention. Radiological imaging suggested possible invasive disease due to sigmoid thickening.

**Plan:**  
The patient underwent a high anterior resection via an open approach due to suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous extensive pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request. During laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was found adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind-ending tube was noted emerging from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon, which was marked for pathological identification.

**Outcome:**  
The patient had an uneventful recovery and reported a good quality of life post-surgery. The decision for a permanent colostomy was made at the patient's request.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to return for any future questions or concerns.
