**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing back pain for the past two years. They have a history of multiple bone metastases in the cervical and thoracic spine, confirmed by an MRI scan. The patient has undergone palliative radiotherapy and 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab. Initially, the patient was on tamoxifen but later switched to letrozole and completed a 2-year course of bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid infusions. The patient was feeling well for about two years but recently experienced slight nausea and abnormal liver function biochemistry. A CT scan revealed a 9 cm lower right liver lobe metastasis, which was treated with continued trastuzumab and another 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy, resulting in a reduction of the metastasis by more than 50%. The metastasis was deemed operable, and the patient underwent an extended right hepatectomy in March 2007.

**Objective:**

- CT scan: 9 cm lower right liver lobe metastasis, reduced by more than 50% post-treatment.

**Assessment:**  
- History of multifocal right breast malignancy treated with mastectomy and axillary clearance in 1993.
- Left mastectomy and axillary clearance for a 23 mm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma nearly 10 years later.
- Histology: 8 mm grade 1 carcinoma and 10 and 25 mm grade 3 carcinomas, no nodal involvement.
