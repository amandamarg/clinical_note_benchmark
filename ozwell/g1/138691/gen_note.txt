**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:17:57 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Reason for Visit:** Trauma to tooth

**Subjective:**  
The patient reported experiencing a trauma to the tooth last night due to a fall, resulting in a fractured front tooth. The patient noted sensitivity when eating or drinking but denied any pain or swelling in the area.

**Objective:**  
Clinical examination revealed a traumatic injury to the right maxillary lateral incisor with an extensive fracture. The pulp was exposed, and there was an extensive loss of tooth structure, with only about 3 mm of the crown remaining. The tooth exhibited normal physiologic mobility. The pulpal exposure was more than 2 mm in diameter. An intraoral periapical radiograph showed an immature root with a blunderbuss apex.

**Assessment:**  
Traumatic injury to the right maxillary lateral incisor with exposed pulp and extensive crown fracture.

**Plan:**  
Due to the parents' apprehension about early tooth extraction, it was decided to avoid extraction and maintain pulp vitality through laser pulpotomy, followed by prosthetic rehabilitation after root formation completion. Informed consent was obtained. A diode laser was used for pulpal amputation. Local anesthesia was administered, and an access cavity was prepared on tooth #12 using outward brush strokes of the bur. A 400 nm focused tip was used in pulsed mode at 2.0 W under standard aseptic conditions and recommended laser protection methods. The tip was moved in contact mode around the periphery of the exposed pulp to remove the coronal pulp without damaging the underlying radicular pulp. Multiple laser energy applications were administered to ablate the pulp and achieve hemostasis. A sterile hemostatic pulp cap was placed.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks. The patient was instructed to contact the office with any concerns or questions in the meantime.
