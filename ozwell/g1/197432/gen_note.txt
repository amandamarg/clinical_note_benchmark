**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits, which have been ongoing for approximately 6 months. The patient reports passing mucus and experiencing more frequent stools. There are no reports of abdominal pain or changes in weight. The patient has a history of bladder exstrophy and has undergone multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5. The patient has experienced recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood. There are no major co-morbidities or family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
During a recent colonoscopy, two large sessile polyps were found in the sigmoid colon, exhibiting irregular patterns suggestive of focally advanced disease. These polyps were removed during surgery, and histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia, but without submucosal invasion. Atypical mucosa was noted around a diverticulum-like structure, but it was not adenomatous. The rest of the colonoscopy was unremarkable, with no other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps elsewhere.

**Assessment:**  
The patient had abnormal polyps that could have potentially become cancerous. Given the difficult endoscopic access and suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgery, surgical intervention was chosen. The patient underwent a high anterior resection with an open approach to ensure proper removal of all abnormal tissue. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request.

**Plan:**  
The surgery was successful, with the right fallopian tube found adherent to the sigmoid colon and a blind-ending tube emerging from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon, which was marked for pathological identification. The patient had an uneventful recovery and reports a good quality of life post-surgery. The patient expressed a desire for a permanent colostomy. No immediate follow-up appointments are needed, but the patient is advised to contact the office with any further concerns or questions.
