Both describe a 56-year-old woman with a history of rectal bleeding, mucus passage, and changes in bowel habits over six months. They mention her medical history of bladder exstrophy and multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation. Both notes detail the colonoscopy findings of two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, the histological examination results, and the decision to opt for surgical intervention due to difficult endoscopic access and suspected intra-abdominal adhesions. They also describe the surgical procedure, the formation of an end colostomy at the patient's request, and her uneventful recovery with a good quality of life post-surgery. The main difference is in the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other a more narrative description."}}
