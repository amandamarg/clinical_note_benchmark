**Patient Information:**  
- **Procedure:** Right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis  
- **Anesthesia:** Epidural anesthesia  

**History:**  
The patient underwent a right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis with epidural anesthesia. During the removal of the epidural catheter, resistance was felt, and the catheter broke 13 cm from the tip. Subsequent X-rays and computed tomography scans confirmed the presence of the catheter fragment inside the patient. Initially, a wait-and-see approach was adopted due to the absence of neurological deficits. The patient did not develop any fever or neurological deficits post-procedure. However, imaging studies after four weeks indicated migration of the catheter. After discussions with the patient and family, surgical removal of the retained catheter was decided.

**Admission:**  
Upon admission, the patient exhibited no neurological deficits.

**Procedure:**  
A laminectomy was performed at L2-3. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. The spinal level requiring treatment and the retained catheter were identified using an image intensifier. The spinal process at L2-3 was exposed, and the L2 spinal process was split using an air drill. The catheter was confirmed to be present between the L2 and L3 spinous processes, with the edge of the catheter found to be broken. The bilateral flavum was removed in the usual manner, revealing the catheter coiled at the surface of the dura mater and covered by a thin reactive film. The catheter was observed heading towards the nerve root.
