Both describe the same medical case involving an 82-year-old female patient who underwent a right total knee arthroplasty with epidural anesthesia. They detail the complication of a broken epidural catheter during removal, the initial wait-and-see approach due to the absence of neurological deficits, and the eventual decision for surgical removal after imaging studies showed catheter migration. The notes also describe the laminectomy procedure performed to remove the catheter, including the identification of the catheter's location, the surgical approach, and the successful removal without complications such as cerebral spinal fluid leakage."}}
