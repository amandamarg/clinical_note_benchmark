They both describe the case of a 1-month-old female infant with two natal teeth causing difficulty in breastfeeding and an ulcerated lesion on the tongue diagnosed as Riga-Fede Disease. Both notes detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment plan, and follow-up, including the refusal of radiographic examination and biopsy by the mother, the surgical removal of one tooth, and the application of glass ionomer cement to the other. The outcome and follow-up results are also consistent in both notes."}}
