**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Patient:** 1-month-old female infant  
**Accompanied by:** Patient's mother  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Difficulty in breastfeeding due to the presence of two teeth since birth.

**History:**  
No abnormalities in medical history. No medication taken at presentation.

**Examination:**  
- Intraoral examination revealed two natal teeth in the mandibular anterior region.
- An ulcerated lesion was observed on the ventral surface of the tongue, measuring 8 mm in diameter, located at the midline anterior portion.
- The lesion appeared to have the impression of the teeth on its center, indicative of repetitive trauma from raking movements of the tongue against the anterior natal teeth.

**Diagnosis:**  
Clinical diagnosis of Riga-Fede Disease due to the repetitive trauma from natal teeth.

**Plan:**  
- Recommended radiographic examination and tongue biopsy to determine if the teeth are supernumerary or regular primary teeth and to make a histopathological diagnosis of the lesion. However, the patient's mother refused permission for these procedures.
- The tooth on the left side presented grade II mobility, posing a risk of displacement and potential swallowing or aspiration. Surgical removal was recommended.
- The tooth on the right side had regular mobility and was preserved. To prevent further trauma and allow wound healing, a small increment of glass ionomer cement was applied to cover the cutting edge of the tooth.

**Outcome:**  
Post-procedure, the infant was able to suck for a longer period, providing relief to both the infant and the mother. The mother was advised to maintain hygiene of the child's tongue wound with saline solution.

**Follow-up:**  
- After five days, the patient returned showing good healing of the lesion.
- After fifteen days, the lesion was completely healed.
- One year of follow-up included clinical and radiographic control.

**Notes:**  
The mother expressed satisfaction with the outcome and was advised to return if any further issues arise.
