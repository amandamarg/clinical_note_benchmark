Both notes mention the patient's achondroplasia, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, as well as the unsuccessful attempt to use a heel elevation. They also highlight the patient's opposition to right leg lengthening and the decision to perform a distal femoral shortening osteotomy on the left leg. The outcome of the surgery and the patient's satisfaction with the result are also noted. Overall, the notes are quite similar in content, though they may differ slightly in structure and detail."}}
