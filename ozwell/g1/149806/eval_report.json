They both mention the patient's severe pain and swelling in the left hip and upper thigh, the history of a hip hemireplacement operation, and the findings from the physical examination and radiographs. Both notes also discuss the planned surgical intervention and the patient's medical history, including the absence of significant past medical issues, smoking, or drug use. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure that was performed in 2010, while the second note outlines the current assessment and plan for surgery scheduled for next week."}}
