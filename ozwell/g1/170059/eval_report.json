Both describe the medical history and findings of a 40-year-old Asian woman who was found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung and a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone. They detail the initial suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, the procedures performed (video-assisted thoracic surgery and curettage), and the postoperative progress. Both notes conclude with the patient being free of disease 41 months after the operation and emphasize the importance of continued monitoring."}}
