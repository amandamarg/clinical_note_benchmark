The first note provides a comprehensive account of the surgical procedure, complications, and postoperative recovery, including the patient's progress over several months.

It includes a plan to inform the family and review the procedure for future reference.\n\nIn summary, while both notes describe the same initial surgical event, they differ significantly in the reported outcome and subsequent details."}}
