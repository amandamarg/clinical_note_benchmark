**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient, with a history of lupus, presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. The patient reported no current issues with a previous left knee ACL reconstruction performed approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system. The tibial WasherLoc was removed about 10 years ago. The patient described the surgical process as uncomfortable but not painful.

**Objective:**  
- **Positioning:** Supine  
- **Incision:** Standard incision with medial parapatellar arthrotomy  
- **Femoral Preparation:** Measured resection technique with intramedullary guide; femur cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation.  
- **Femoral Component:** Initial placement of size 4 femoral prosthesis noted to overhang medially and laterally; decision made to downsize.  
- **Bone Mulch Screw:** Located in lateral femoral condyle; removed after clearing with a curette.  
- **Tibial Preparation:** Intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope; size 3 tibial component and 9 mm poly placed; knee tight in flexion and extension.  
- **Additional Resection:** 2 mm resection on proximal tibia performed.  
- **Complications:** Lateral femoral condyle fracture noted during trialing; subsequent fracture of medial femoral condyle.  
- **Consultation:** Intraoperative consultation with adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon.  
- **Outcome:** Immediate surgical correction not possible due to improper implants; femoral and tibial canals reamed.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient did not survive the surgery despite best efforts.

**Plan:**  
- Inform family and provide support.  
- Review surgical procedure and complications for future reference.  

**Family Communication:**  
Family informed of the outcome. Expressed gratitude for efforts made.
