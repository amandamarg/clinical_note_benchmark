**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  
**Department:** [Redacted]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with pain and restricted range of motion in the left hip joint for two months, accompanied by gait disturbance.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports severe pain in the left hip, exacerbated by flexion or rotation, affecting gait. No lifestyle habits or comorbidities are believed to contribute to the condition.

**Physical Examination:**  
Examination reveals severe gait disturbance secondary to hip pain, aggravated by hip joint flexion or rotation. No lifestyle habits or comorbidities are thought to cause femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN).

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Anteroposterior view of the left hip shows sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip.
- MRI scan indicates increased joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip.
- Femoral head necrosis detected on the contralateral side, though the patient reports no pain.

**Diagnosis:**  
Idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

**Treatment and Follow-up:**  
The patient underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) for treatment and was discharged in good condition three weeks post-surgery without specific complications. Follow-up was conducted via regular outpatient visits.

**Subsequent Developments:**  
One year post-initial surgery, the patient reported pain and limited range of motion in the contralateral hip joint, with gait disturbance persisting for two months and worsening over three weeks. A second THA was performed one year after the first, with the patient discharged in good condition and followed up via regular outpatient visits.

**Additional Observations:**  
At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than at the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, initially overlooked as weight gain. Post-second surgery, the patient experienced intensifying feelings of helplessness, central obesity, and muscle mass reduction in both upper and lower limbs, worsening over a three-month outpatient follow-up period. These signs were not significant enough to warrant further investigation.

**Referral:**  
One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology due to progressive worsening of central symptoms.
