Both notes describe a 43-year-old female with abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite, with tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa. They both mention marfanoid features and a family history of Marfan's syndrome. The laboratory and imaging results in both notes support a likely diagnosis of appendicitis, and both describe an attempted appendicectomy with subsequent exploratory procedures revealing a herniation of the right colon into the chest. \n\nHowever, there is a significant difference in the outcome. In the first note, the patient makes a good recovery postoperatively and is discharged a week later. In the second note, the patient unfortunately passes away due to complications from the herniation. This difference in outcome is a major distinction between the two notes."}}
