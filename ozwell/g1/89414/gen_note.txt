**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain for the past 6 hours.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports that the abdominal pain started as generalized but has now localized to the right side. 
- Associated symptoms include nausea and loss of appetite. 
- The pain worsens with movement, and an intramuscular morphine injection did not provide relief.

**Physical Examination:**
- Tenderness noted in the right upper quadrant and right iliac fossa.
- Rebound tenderness and guarding present.
- Positive Rovsing sign.
- Normal bowel sounds.

**Additional Findings:**
- Marfanoid features observed, including long span of upper limbs, high arched palate, and a very soft early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation.
- Family history of Marfan's syndrome, but no genetic testing has been done to confirm the diagnosis.

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**
- Blood tests show pyrexia, raised white cell count, and elevated C-reactive protein, supporting a likely diagnosis of appendicitis.
- Abdominal X-ray shows an absence of gas in the right side of the bowel.
- Chest X-ray shows no obvious abnormality.

**Procedures:**
- An appendicectomy was attempted through a standard right iliac fossa incision. 
- During the procedure, a small amount of free fluid was found, but the right iliac fossa contained only a normal-looking gall bladder and small bowel. 
- No sign of the caecum, appendix, ascending or proximal transverse colon was found. 
- The terminal ileum was observed to run up under the right lobe of the liver towards the hilum.
- The right iliac fossa wound was closed, and an exploratory laparoscopy was performed. 
- During laparoscopy, the liver was retracted to view under the right liver lobe. 
- The proximal transverse colon was found running up towards the liver hilum, suggesting a possible herniation of the right colon into the chest.

**Plan:**
- A CT thorax and abdomen is required to define the anatomy involved and to gain a better understanding of the situation for further management.

**Outcome:**
- Unfortunately, the patient eventually passed away. The CT scan revealed a herniation of the right colon into the chest, which caused complications that could not be resolved despite medical efforts. 

**Family Communication:**
- The family was informed about the patient's passing and the complications that arose. They were encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
