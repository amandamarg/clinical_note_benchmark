**Time:** 8:25:03 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Injury in the right leg following a minor fall.  
- **History of Present Illness:**  
  - The patient experienced a minor fall resulting in an injury to the right leg a month ago. Initially diagnosed with a stress fracture of the proximal tibia and received a plaster cast at a different institution.  
  - Upon evaluation a month later, there was no evidence of union, leading to surgery involving dual plating.  
  - On the 3rd postoperative day, the patient was diagnosed with compartment syndrome. During fasciotomy, necrosis of the entire anterior compartment was noted, and the tibialis anterior and part of the peroneus musculature were debrided and excised.  
  - The fasciotomy wound became infected, with the infection spreading to the knee joint. Wound cleaning and repeated debridements were performed for 2 weeks with parenteral antibiotics, but there was no improvement.  
  - The patient was advised amputation but did not consent and sought further management at our center.  

**Current Condition:**  
- The wound is covered with necrotic tissue and slough, with the middle 4/5 of the tibia bone exposed and blackening at the lower end.  
- Active pus discharge from the knee joint through the medial wound.  
- Painful knee joint movements limited to 10°–30°.  
- Ankle exhibits 20° of equinus deformity.  

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension, on medication for the last 8 years.  
- No history of diabetes or other medical or surgical illnesses.  

**Biochemical Investigations:**  
- Hemoglobin: 10.2 mg%  
- Other parameters within normal limits.  

**Microbiological Findings:**  
- Swab from the wound cultured Staphylococcus aureus.  

**Treatment and Procedures:**  
- The patient underwent the first debridement today. Three holes were drilled in the tibia to verify bone viability, with active bleeding observed at all sites. A thorough debridement of the wound was performed, removing all dead and necrotic tissue.  
- Post-surgery, the entire lower leg was wetted with sterile distilled water and covered with a sterile plastic bag.  

**Plan:**  
- The patient is advised to return for follow-up in a week to monitor the condition of the wound and assess for any improvement.
