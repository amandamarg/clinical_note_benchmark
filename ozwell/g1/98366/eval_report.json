Both notes mention the initial ultrasound findings of increased echogenicity, the subsequent MRI revealing a congenital PL muscle variant, and the decision for a non-operative conservative plan due to the absence of pain or functional limitations. The main difference is in the presentation and structure of the information, with the clinical note being more concise and formatted as a standard medical record."}}
