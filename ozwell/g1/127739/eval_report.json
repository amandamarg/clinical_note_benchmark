Both describe a 77-year-old female patient who presented to the Neurology clinic for evaluation of unexplained syncope and reported cognitive difficulties over the past one to two years. They both mention a family history of progressive dementia, an episodic right visual field event, and findings of right-sided homonymous hemianopsia confirmed by a visual field test. Both notes detail the brain MRI findings of small multiple nonspecific white matter lesions and asymmetrical atrophy of the left occipital lobe. They also discuss the patient's lack of awareness of her visual symptoms, the cognitive impairment noted on bedside tests, and the additional testing performed, including a nuclear medicine brain SPECT perfusion scan and a brain PET using the Florbetapir amyloid tracer. Both notes conclude with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) and mention the medications Donepezil and Memantine."}}
