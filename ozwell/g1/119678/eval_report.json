They both mention the patient's increased water intake, episodes of abnormal movements, low serum sodium levels, and the diagnosis of psychogenic polydipsia. Both notes also discuss the patient's history of anxiety, weakness, and the advice to increase fluid intake, leading to excessive water consumption. The treatment plan involving behavior therapy and medication is also consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the level of detail and specific information provided, with the first note being more comprehensive and detailed compared to the second clinical note."}}
