**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:13:05 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Increased water intake and two episodes of abnormal movements.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred from the medical department for increased water intake and two episodes of abnormal movements. The abnormal movements were characterized by sudden tightening of limbs and jaws, jerky movements, urinary incontinence, and loss of consciousness. These episodes occurred about a month prior to the visit. The patient has been evaluated and was found to have low serum sodium levels. The jerky movements were attributed to hyponatremia-induced seizures due to increased water intake.

The patient reports a history of functioning well until 2 to 3 years ago when an episode of fever occurred. Following this, the patient began experiencing weakness and anxiety. A doctor advised increased fluid intake, leading to a gradual increase to about 10 liters of water per day. The patient feels thirsty while talking or after urination and needs to drink water every five to ten minutes. Anxiety and irritability occur if water is not available or if family members attempt to restrict water intake. The patient reports decreased appetite and weight loss over the past 2 years, preoccupation with water intake, and always carrying a 2-liter bottle. The patient has lost interest in work and stopped attending due to weakness and fatigue.

**Review of Systems:**  
- No sadness of mood or depressive symptoms.  
- No psychotic symptoms.  
- No other obsessive thoughts, images, or impulses.

**Assessment:**  
Based on the information provided, the patient appears to have a condition called psychogenic polydipsia, characterized by excessive water intake due to psychological factors.
