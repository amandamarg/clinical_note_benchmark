They both describe the case of a 71-year-old man with sudden onset back pain, weakness in both legs, and sensory changes. Both notes mention the mid-thoracic back pain, the neurologic examination findings, and the imaging results showing a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression. They also discuss the plan for early spine surgery for T8 decompression and stabilization, the preoperative spinal embolization, and the surgical procedure performed. Additionally, both notes mention the patient's medical history of taking anti-arrhythmic medications and the absence of significant past medical history. The follow-up plan and the uneventful nature of the operation are also noted in both."}}
