They both describe the medical history and current condition of a 77-year-old man with bladder cancer. Both notes detail his initial presentation in April 2016 with gross hematuria, the diagnosis of papillary tumors, and subsequent treatments including transurethral resection and intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C. They also mention the recurrence of multifocal bladder cancer in August 2018, the high-grade Ta urothelial cancer diagnosis, and the patient's current symptoms of nocturia and daytime frequency. Both notes discuss the potential treatment options, including TUR BT and bladder preservation with intravesical BCG, and the consideration of a radical cystoprostatectomy. The recommendation in both notes leans towards a bladder preservation approach with intravesical BCG, with further discussion needed with the patient."}}
