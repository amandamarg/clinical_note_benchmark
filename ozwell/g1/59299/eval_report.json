They both mention the patient's past medical history, the reason for admission, details of the surgery including anesthesia and duration, and the postoperative symptoms of bilateral shoulder pain and weakness. Both notes also include findings from the orthopedic consultation and the plan for further evaluation and follow-up. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more structured format with specific headings, while the context information is more narrative."}}
