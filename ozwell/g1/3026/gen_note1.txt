Pain, swelling, and redness on the left leg.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain, swelling, and redness on the left leg for approximately one month. The redness has become localized to the front of the leg, forming a fluid-filled, red mass. A draining sinus developed on the red mass, discharging a thick fluid with a chalk-like material through the shiny skin via the sinus. The patient denies any specific trauma that could have caused these symptoms.

- Liver cirrhosis  
- Tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago, treated with open reduction and internal fixation  
- Sciatic nerve injury  
- Distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture 8 years post initial trauma, treated with stent insertion in the femoral artery

**Imaging History:**  
- Radiographs and angiography performed at the time of femoral artery rupture, revealing a mass on the leg and an obstruction in the popliteal artery.

**Functional Status:**  
Prior to current symptoms, the patient reported no difficulty with daily life functions, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and some sensory reduction in the foot due to the sciatic nerve injury.

**Current Treatment:**  
The patient was maintained with a long leg splint after admission.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Range of motion: Knee flexion 0 to 100 degrees; Ankle dorsiflexion 0 degrees, plantar flexion 5 degrees.  
- Toes: Clawing deformity present.  
- Motor strength: Ankle dorsiflexion grade 0, plantar flexion grade 3.  
- Sensation: Absent in the first web space and medial aspect of the foot. Sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient's symptoms and history suggest a need for further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up requirements will be discussed with the patient after test results are available.
