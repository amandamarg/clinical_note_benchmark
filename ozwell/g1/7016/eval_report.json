Both describe the case of a 56-year-old male patient with a persistent orocutaneous fistula following the enucleation of a plasmacytoma from the left mandible three years ago. They detail the patient's history of unsuccessful surgeries to close the fistula, the CT imaging findings, and the surgical intervention using the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap. Both notes include information about the surgical procedure, postoperative care, and follow-up plans. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's name and the date in the clinical note."}}
