**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Persistent orocutaneous fistula.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a persistent orocutaneous fistula. The patient has undergone three unsuccessful surgeries to close the fistula. The failure of previous surgeries was attributed to ineffective management of the dead space surrounding the fistula.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Plasmacytoma enucleated from the left mandible 3 years ago.

**Imaging:**  
CT images revealed a 3x2 cm diameter defect between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible, near the left submandibular gland.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
A surgical solution was devised to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia. The fistula was excised, and healthy oral and cutaneous tissues were prepared. The incision was extended in the posterior and anterior directions. The submandibular gland was mobilized, and a soft tissue tunnel was prepared. The gland was rotated and sutured to the recipient site, and the flap was closed.

**Surgical Details:**  
- Mobilization of the gland was achieved by protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. The surrounding soft tissues were dissected, and the gland was rotated through the soft tissue tunnel while preserving the pedicle.
- Sutures were done with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures to stabilize the rotated gland.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient reports feeling good post-surgery. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for next week to check the incisions and the healing process of the tissues.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the healing process and ensure proper closure of the fistula.
- Follow-up appointment next week.

**Instructions:**  
The patient was advised to take care of themselves and return for the follow-up appointment as scheduled.
