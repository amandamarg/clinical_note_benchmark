They both describe the case of a 77-year-old female with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, which had been present for three years and had grown over time. Both notes mention the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), the physical examination findings, and the imaging results. They also describe the surgical procedure to excise the mass, the postoperative outcome, and the histopathological confirmation of a glomus tumor. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of a family discussion and follow-up plan in the clinical note."}}
