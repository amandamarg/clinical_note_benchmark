**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:29:13 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [MRN]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a sensitive mass on the right wrist, which has been present for approximately three years. The mass has increased in size over time, and the patient reports worsening pain and sensitivity to light contact. The patient denies any cold sensitivity or history of trauma to the area. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsal-radial aspect of the hand, which was treated. Post-treatment, the patient developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), affecting hand mobility. A stellate ganglion block was attempted without relief, and the patient has been performing home exercises to improve range of motion.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed a small, round, tender, and painful nodule measuring approximately 5mm x 5mm on the right wrist. There was no pain radiation or Tinel's sign noted. Imaging studies showed no abnormalities except for some osteopenia.

**Assessment:**  
The clinical presentation and examination findings suggest a neuroma, possibly evolving from a cutaneous nerve or the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve.

**Plan:**  
The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the mass. Intraoperatively, a maroon-colored mass connected to a cutaneous nerve branch was identified and excised along with the nerve. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were confirmed to be uninvolved. Postoperatively, the patient reported being pain-free and expressed satisfaction with the surgical outcome. Diagnostic pathological stains confirmed the presence of a glomus tumor, with strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin. The tumor was successfully removed, and no further issues are anticipated. The patient will be monitored closely with regular follow-up appointments.

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family expressed gratitude for the care provided.

**Follow-Up:**  
Regular follow-up appointments are scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and ensure no recurrence of symptoms.
