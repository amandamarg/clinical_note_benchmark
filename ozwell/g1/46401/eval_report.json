The second case does not detail post-surgical oncology treatment.\n\n7. **Follow-up and Patient Education:**\n   - Both patients were referred to medical oncology and advised to follow up, but specific follow-up details and patient education are more elaborated in John's case.\n\nOverall, while both notes involve malignant mesothelioma, the specifics of the presentation, diagnostic findings, surgical interventions, and follow-up differ between the two cases."}}
