Both describe the medical history and recent developments of a 40-year-old female patient with a history of breast cancer. They detail her initial treatment, including a lumpectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Both notes mention the recent discovery of a palpable lump on her right chest wall, the results of imaging and biopsy, and the subsequent treatment plan. The main difference is in the format and slight variations in wording, but the core information remains consistent across both notes."}}
