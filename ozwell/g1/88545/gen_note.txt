**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling fine today. They have a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with concomitant septal myectomy performed two months ago. The patient experienced syncope two months post-surgery, leading to a hospital visit.

**Objective:**  
- **Initial Presentation:** Bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute and stable blood pressure. No jugular venous distension noted. Lung examination revealed adequate aeration in all fields with no crackles or wheezing. The point of maximum impulse was not displaced. Regular heart sounds with variable intensity were noted, with no atrial or ventricular gallops. An early systolic murmur grade II/VI was noted at the left sternal border.
- **Intervention:** Due to symptomatic bradycardia, a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications. The patient was discharged home 24 hours post-implantation.
- **Follow-Up:** Four months post-pacemaker implantation, the patient reported no complaints. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function and prosthetic aortic valve function with no abnormalities.
- **Current Visit:** The patient relocated and was seen for the first time at our institution. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular chamber dimensions, systolic function, and bioprosthetic valve function. The pacer wire was correctly positioned in the right ventricular apex. An abnormal color flow signal was noted arising from the interventricular septum with a predominant flow away from the transducer into the left ventricular cavity. Continuous and pulse wave Doppler interrogation demonstrated a continuous flow with a predominant diastolic component, consistent with coronary arterial flow. This abnormal color flow signal traversing the interventricular septum was not identified in previous studies.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is currently asymptomatic. The findings of the echocardiogram are consistent with coronary arterial flow, and the abnormal color flow signal is a new finding.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. The patient is advised to return if any symptoms arise before the scheduled follow-up.
