Both describe the medical history and follow-up of a 74-year-old female patient who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with septal myectomy. They detail her initial presentation with syncope and bradycardia, the subsequent implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker, and her follow-up visits. Both notes mention the echocardiogram findings, including normal left ventricular function and the discovery of an abnormal color flow signal consistent with coronary arterial flow. The patient is asymptomatic in both notes, and no intervention is recommended for the new echocardiogram finding. The plan includes scheduling a follow-up appointment and advising the patient to return if symptoms arise."}}
