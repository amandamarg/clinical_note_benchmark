**Physician:** Dr. X  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with a problem in the left leg due to a fracture that is not healing properly.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient is a labor worker who sustained a left femur fracture (both shaft and neck) eight months ago from a road traffic accident. Initial treatment included an external fixator application for the femoral shaft fracture and open debridement for the wound site, followed by immobilization with a Thomas splint. The treatment was delayed due to an infection at the open wound and pin site. The patient was referred to our center after eight months of the injury.

**Recent Tests and Results:**  
- Blood tests showed raised serum inflammatory markers: ESR 25 mm/hr and CRP 12 g/L.
- Ultrasound evaluation showed nil collection or edema.
- CT evaluation was performed to assess the femoral neck fracture and femoral head.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a confirmed non-union of the left femoral shaft fracture and ipsilateral femoral neck fracture. There is no local inflammation around the fracture sites or the healed wound.

**Plan:**  
Recommend surgical intervention to correct the non-union. The patient is comfortable with proceeding with the surgery. Surgery will be scheduled. The patient is advised to avoid activities that may cause further harm to the leg.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
- Take care of the leg and avoid any activities that may exacerbate the condition.
- Await further instructions regarding the scheduled surgery.

**Follow-Up:**  
Schedule surgery and provide pre-operative instructions.
