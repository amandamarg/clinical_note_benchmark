Both notes detail the diagnostic studies performed, including neck ultrasound, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and MRI of the neck, and they both describe the findings of these studies. They also outline the procedure performed, which was a Sistrunk procedure with total thyroidectomy and central neck exploration, and mention the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma metastasis. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed histopathological findings and post-operative treatment information, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary."}}
