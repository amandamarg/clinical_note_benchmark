**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with a growing mass along the neck for the past 3 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a mass located along the midline of the neck over the thyrohyoid membrane, measuring approximately 3 x 1.5 cm. Additionally, the patient has noticed a 3 x 2 cm nodule in the left thyroid gland.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- **Neck Ultrasound:** Revealed a calcified heterogenic-hypoechoic solid lesion of 30 x 18 mm at the level of the hyoid bone in the submental area. Several hypoechoic nodules were identified in the left lobe of the thyroid gland, some with micro calcifications. No lesions were identified in the right lobe.
- **Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB):** Conducted on both the midline neck mass and the left lobe nodule. Results indicated papillary thyroidal carcinoma for the midline neck mass and benign cytology for the nodule in the left thyroid lobe.
- **MRI of the Neck:** Showed a 30 x 20 mm midline solid soft tissue mass with hyperintense signal post-contrast media injection. Cystic changes in the mass and evidence of invasion into the infrahyoid muscle group were noted.

**Procedure:**  
A Sistrunk procedure with total thyroidectomy and central neck exploration was performed due to suspicion of simultaneous de novo development of papillary carcinoma in the thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) and the thyroid gland. Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure. During the Sistrunk procedure, a solid mass invading the infrahyoid muscle group was encountered, and gross total resection of the tumor was performed. A total thyroidectomy was also conducted. During central neck exploration, samples of the suspected lymph nodes were sent for frozen section pathology, confirming the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma metastasis.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has been diagnosed with papillary carcinoma metastasis. We will monitor the condition closely and schedule regular follow-up appointments to ensure proper management and care.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be seen at the next scheduled appointment for further evaluation and management.
