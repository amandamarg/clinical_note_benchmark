**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Abdominal pain persisting for 2 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain that has persisted for 2 months. The pain is localized in an area ranging from the right upper to the right lateral abdomen and has been gradually worsening. The patient initially visited another hospital emergency department 1 month after the onset of the pain, where gastrointestinal tract spasm was suspected and treated with tiquizium bromide. The medication partially relieved the abdominal pain, but most of the pain persisted. Nephrolithiasis was suspected, but the result of a workup by a urologist was negative. The pain is exacerbated upon changing posture, suggesting a somatic rather than visceral origin. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis at age 32 in Latin America.

**Social History:**  
- Moved to Japan for work approximately 3 years prior to the initial visit to this hospital.  
- Returned to Latin America once about 6 to 7 months before presenting at the clinic.

**Weight History:**  
- Weight increased from 130 kg to 145 kg after returning to Japan.

**Previous Evaluations:**  
- Hematologic laboratory analysis, urine analysis, gastroscopy, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were performed, but no cause of abdominal pain was detected.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be referred for further examination at our hospital to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.
