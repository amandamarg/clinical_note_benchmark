Both describe the medical history and current condition of a 41-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). They detail her transition from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis following a severe episode of peritonitis, the failure of her transplantation plans, and the complications she faced with vascular access thrombosis and recurrent infections. Both notes mention the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) and the use of anticoagulation therapy. They also highlight the patient's improved quality of life following the successful use of a left femoral graft. The main difference is in the structure and presentation, with the clinical note being more structured with sections like Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan."}}
