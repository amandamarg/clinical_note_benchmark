Both notes mention her previous total left hip arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritis, the subsequent revision surgery due to femoral bone loss and a pseudo-tumor, and the complications following surgery, including infection and the need for a two-stage replacement of the femoral prosthesis. They also describe the surgical intervention involving a free flap for wound coverage due to the lack of suitable local flaps and receptor vessels. The main difference is that the first note is more detailed and includes specific surgical and postoperative details, while the second note is a clinical summary with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
