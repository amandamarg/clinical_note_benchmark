**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [MRN]  
**Date of Birth:** [DOB]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports undergoing a surgical repair of a macular hole in the left eye, which involved a vitrectomy followed by the instillation of a mixture of C3F8 gas and sterile air into the vitreous cavity. The patient was advised to maintain a face-down position postoperatively to facilitate hole closure and improve vision but was unable to do so due to complications. The patient experienced a headache, symptomatic bradycardia with a heart rate of 25, and heart rhythm problems post-surgery. The patient has a history of long-standing coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and a past surgical history of right carotid endarterectomy.

**Objective:**  
On postoperative day one, the patient had elevated intraocular pressure, which was addressed by an anterior chamber paracentesis. Later that day, the patient presented to the ED with a headache and symptomatic bradycardia. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted, correcting the dysrhythmia. The retinal surgeon was not informed of these events, and the patient was seen again on postoperative day five with a flat anterior chamber and markedly elevated intraocular pressure of 88. The ophthalmologist lowered the pressure by withdrawing gas from the vitreous cavity. Later that day, the patient developed acute mental status changes and presented to the ED. A CT scan demonstrated intracranial air in addition to the gas bubble in the eye.

**Assessment:**  
1. Post-surgical complications following macular hole repair with vitrectomy and gas instillation.
2. Symptomatic bradycardia and dysrhythmia, corrected with dual-chamber permanent pacemaker implantation.
3. Elevated intraocular pressure postoperatively, managed with anterior chamber paracentesis and gas withdrawal.
4. Intracranial air post-procedure, as evidenced by CT scan.

**Plan:**  
- Recommend regular follow-up with ophthalmologist and retinal surgeon.
- Monitor for any further complications or changes in symptoms.
- Patient advised to return if any concerns or questions arise.
