Both notes detail the procedure, complications, and subsequent medical interventions. They mention the use of C3F8 gas, the need for a face-down position post-surgery, the development of symptomatic bradycardia, the implantation of a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker, elevated intraocular pressure, and the presence of intracranial air. The main difference is in the format and structure: the first note is a narrative case description, while the second is a clinical note with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
