Both describe the same patient's medical history, diagnosis, and treatment plan. They detail the patient's intractable right arm pain and swelling due to primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis, the complications from chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the suboptimal pain control despite opioid therapy. Both notes mention the diagnostic brachial plexus block and the patient's progressive weakness in the right upper extremity. The imaging studies and the assessment and plan for further management are also consistent between the two notes."}}
