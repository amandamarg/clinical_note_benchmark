The first note is a detailed narrative of the patient's medical history, symptoms, diagnostic findings, and treatment course, including specific medical procedures and outcomes. The second note is a clinical summary that outlines the patient's history, presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, radiographic and angiography findings, clinical course, and outcome in a more structured format. Both notes cover the same key points, such as the patient's history of liver cirrhosis, previous injuries and surgeries, current symptoms, and the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis, but the first note provides more in-depth information and context."}}
