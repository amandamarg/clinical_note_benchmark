They both describe the same clinical case of a 58-year-old male who presented with pain at the left side of the base of his penis after excessive forceful masturbation. Both notes detail the patient's unremarkable medical and surgical history, the findings from the physical examination, the investigations conducted (including MRI results), the diagnosis of trauma causing rupture of the cavernous body, and the management plan involving conservative treatment followed by surgical intervention due to abscess formation. The follow-up information regarding the patient's recovery and sexual function is also consistent between the two notes."}}
