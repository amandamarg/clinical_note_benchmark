Both notes mention:\n\n1. The patient's age and gender are not specified.\n2. The chief complaint of left peripheral facial palsy, characterized by an inability to close the left eye and drooping of the corner of the mouth.\n3. A history of facial nerve palsy with the first occurrence at the age of three years and one month, treated with corticosteroids.\n4. A diagnosis of pure red cell hypoplasia at the age of three years and nine months, with severe anaemia and a likely autoimmune cause.\n5. A second episode of left facial palsy at four years and four months old, accompanied by a strength deficit on the left side of the body and a haemorrhagic stroke, with high diastolic blood pressure values suggesting central involvement.\n6. A third episode of left peripheral facial palsy at the age of five years and six months, treated with corticosteroids.\n7. A plan for follow-up to monitor the patient's condition.\n\nThe main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the clinical course and treatment, including the use of prednisone and vitamin B supplementation, and the presence of a furrowed tongue as a synchronous anomaly."}}
