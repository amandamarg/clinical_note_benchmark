Both notes cover the patient's history of present illness, past medical history, obstetric history, vital signs, laboratory data, imaging studies, surgical findings, and plan. However, the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the events leading up to the emergency laparotomy, including the patient's previous pregnancies and the complications encountered. The second note is a clinical summary that focuses on the patient's current condition, surgical findings, and plan for treatment. Overall, they are similar in content but differ in the level of detail and presentation."}}
