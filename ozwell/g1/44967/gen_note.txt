**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:27:50 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Age:** [Patient's Age]  
**Gender:** Female  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Weakness and pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports feeling very weak and experiencing significant pain. She has a history of massive vaginal bleeding 20 days post-cesarean section, requiring hospitalization and transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells due to a hemoglobin level of 5.6 gr/dL. A week after discharge, she presented to another center with vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain and was referred to this hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of placental retention. Ultrasonography at that time showed an irregular contour in the endometrial cavity.

**Past Medical History:**  
- No major medical problems reported.

**Obstetric History:**  
- First pregnancy: Vaginal delivery following a healthy pregnancy 8 years ago.
- Second pregnancy: Terminated via hysterotomy due to multiple fetal abnormalities, including hydrocephalus.
- Third pregnancy: Diagnosed with anterior placenta previa, resulting in a planned repeat cesarean section. Postoperative course was uneventful until the aforementioned bleeding episode.

**Vital Signs on Admission:**  
- Blood Pressure: 90/60 mmHg  
- Heart Rate: 110/minute  

**Laboratory Data:**  
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 gr/dL  
- Serum human chorionic gonadotropin: Negative  

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Ultrasonography revealed free fluid filling the pelvis and lower abdomen.

**Surgical Findings:**  
An emergency laparotomy was performed after obtaining informed consent, including the possibility of hysterectomy. Approximately 1000 mL of free blood was drained from the abdominal cavity. A full-thickness defect on the anterior wall of the uterus was observed, involving the hysterotomy incision. Both sides of the incision were occupied by irregular placental tissue with no obvious normal myometrium, and blood was oozing from the defect.

**Plan:**  
The patient was informed of the need for a hysterectomy. Post-procedure, she will require rest and a follow-up appointment in a few weeks.
