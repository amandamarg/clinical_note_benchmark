**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling very weak. They have a history of a car accident 8 months ago, resulting in a neck fracture and subsequent quadriplegia. The patient also had a nasogastric tube inserted and a past history of discharge of food from the foramen of the tracheostomy tube after oral feeding.

**Objective:**  
- **Initial Presentation:** Massive bleeding from the tracheostomy stoma site, unstable vital signs with blood pressure below 80/60, and non-palpable peripheral pulse.  
- **Surgical Intervention:** Urgent surgery was performed under general anesthesia via the tracheostomy tube. Rigid bronchoscopy revealed tracheal stenosis below the vocal cords, but a clear view of the trachea was not possible due to the patient's critical condition and severe tracheal stenosis.  
- **Surgical Findings and Procedure:** A tracheoesophageal fistula was identified in the membranous part of the trachea, behind the tracheostomy stoma. Bleeding was controlled, attributed to the pressure of the tracheostomy cuff. The tracheostomy stoma site was dissected, and the procedure included division and ligature of the innominate artery and separation of the trachea from the divided artery. The tracheal defect was repaired and reinforced with strap muscle.  
- **Post-Operative Status:** The tracheostomy tube was reinserted, and a jejunostomy tube was placed. The patient's vital signs stabilized post-operation. Neurologic examination remained unchanged, but the right radial pulse was weaker than the left. The patient was discharged after 13 days.  

**Follow-Up:**  
Two months post-discharge, the patient was readmitted for repair of the tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Endoscopy revealed a large foramen in the anterior wall of the esophagus below the upper esophageal sphincter.

**Plan:**  
Review the patient's medical records and discuss the next steps for ongoing management and care.
