They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 27-year-old man who suffered multiple traumas from a car accident, resulting in quadriplegia and complications related to a tracheostomy. Both notes detail the initial presentation of massive bleeding from the tracheostomy site, the urgent surgical intervention, and the identification of a tracheoesophageal fistula. They also describe the post-operative status, including the reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube and the placement of a jejunostomy tube. Additionally, both notes mention the patient's readmission for repair of the tracheoesophageal fistula and the development of deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, and septic shock, leading to the patient's unfortunate passing."}}
