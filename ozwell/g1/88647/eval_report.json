Both notes cover the patient's admission to the obstetrics ward for anticoagulation adjustment during pregnancy, her medical history, the development of symptoms after heparin administration, and the subsequent medical interventions. They both mention the patient's neurological deterioration, confirmation of brain death, and the decision to prolong maternal homeostasis for fetal development. The first note provides a more detailed account of the medical management and outcomes, including specific treatments and the eventual delivery of the infant. The second note is more concise, focusing on the initial presentation, interventions, and the plan for further discussions with the family."}}
