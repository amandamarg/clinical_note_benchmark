They both describe the same patient's medical history, treatment, and current condition. Both notes mention the patient's history of dystonia and spasticity in the left upper limb due to tuberculous meningitis, the botulinum toxin injection received to relieve these symptoms, and the subsequent development of edema and pain in the left upper limb. They also detail the treatment plan, including anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban and the use of a sling and compression therapy.
