Both notes mention the use of dexamethasone, epidural blood patches, dihydroergotamine mesylate, and the patient's response to these treatments. They also discuss the negative results of the CT myelogram and the persistent symptoms despite various interventions. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more concise summary of the patient's current status and treatment plan, while the context information includes more detailed descriptions of the surgical procedures and the patient's long-term follow-up."}}
