Both describe the case of a 40-year-old man with a painful mass on the medial side of his arm, which was diagnosed as a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor, specifically an ancient schwannoma. They both detail the patient's history, clinical examination findings, MRI results, surgical procedure, biopsy results, and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the case, including the surgical procedure and pathology findings, while the second note is a concise clinical summary."}}
