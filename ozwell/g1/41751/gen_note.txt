**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:35:28 PM  

**Patient Complaint:**  
The patient presented with a painful mass on the medial side of the arm.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient first noticed the mass 10 years ago, and it has grown very slowly to its current size of approximately 6-7 cm in length. The patient does not recall any history of significant trauma.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- The mass is solid and not very sensitive to pressure.
- Tinel's like sensation is produced along the median nerve when tapped over the mass.
- The patient experiences numbness in the distribution of the median nerve in the palm.
- No motor weaknesses or muscle atrophy detected.
- No cutaneous pigmented lesions present.

**Imaging:**  
MRI examination showed a 6 cm long, well-circumscribed mass in close proximity to the neurovascular bundle of the arm. The lesion had a relatively homogenous low signal, slightly lower to the muscle, on T1 images. On T1 fat suppressed images, there was increased gadolinium enhancement at the periphery of the mass with a nonenhancing low signal central area. No peri-tumoral edema was present, and a line of fat surrounded the tumor.

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the long history, clinical, and MRI features, the diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor arising from the median nerve was supported.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
A longitudinal incision centered over the tumor bulk was performed. The tumor had an eccentric position and was firmly attached to the median nerve. An incisional biopsy was performed, and a tissue sample was taken from the proximal pole of the mass. The sample was considered representative of the entire pathology macroscopically and was sent for frozen section.

**Biopsy Results:**  
The intra-operative biopsy examination revealed nuclear atypia, but significant mitotic activity was not seen. The lesion was characterized as a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The decision to preserve the median nerve and perform a marginal tumor excision was undertaken. The patient was informed that the mass is a benign tumor and can be removed while preserving the median nerve.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will need to return for a follow-up appointment to ensure proper healing.
