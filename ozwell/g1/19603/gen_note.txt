**Chief Complaint:** Difficulty swallowing  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing difficulty swallowing, which began approximately one month ago. Initially, the patient had trouble swallowing solids, and the condition has progressed to include difficulty swallowing liquids. The patient has also experienced significant weight loss, approximately 15 kg over the past month.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Cancer Antigen CA 125 Levels:** Elevated, indicating a potential health issue.  
- **Upper Digestive Endoscopy:** Suggests compression of the esophagus.  
- **Endoscopic Ultrasound:** Attempted biopsy was unsuccessful due to extreme esophageal compression.  
- **Thoracic, Abdominal, and Pelvic CT:** Revealed suspect pulmonary nodules and a mass compressing the esophagus.  
- **Pelvic MRI:** Confirmed the presence of a tumoral nodule near the uterine cervix.  
- **Cardiologic Evaluation:** Showed mild pericardial effusion with no significant modifications in cardiac function.

**Plan:**  
- Further tests are required to determine the best course of treatment.  
- The patient's condition will be monitored closely.  
- A gastrostomy feeding tube has been placed to ensure adequate nutrition.

**Discussion:**  
The findings are concerning, particularly the mass compressing the esophagus and the tumoral nodule near the uterine cervix. The elevated CA 125 levels and suspect pulmonary nodules also warrant further investigation. The patient has been informed of the current findings and the need for additional testing. The mild pericardial effusion will be monitored, but it does not currently affect cardiac function.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for further diagnostic evaluations and will continue to be monitored for any changes in condition. The patient has been advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
