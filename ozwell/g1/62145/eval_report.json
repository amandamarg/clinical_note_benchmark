Both notes detail the patient's initial symptoms of pain, swelling in the left temporomandibular joint, and fever, as well as the subsequent discovery of an abscess and the initial treatment with surgical drainage and antibiotics. They also both describe the patient's return to the hospital with recurrent symptoms, the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, and the involvement of multiple medical specialties in the treatment plan. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the entire case progression, including the eventual improvement with antifungal treatment, while the second note is a clinical summary focusing on the initial assessment, treatment, and follow-up plan."}}
