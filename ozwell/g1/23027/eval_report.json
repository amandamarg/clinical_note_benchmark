They both describe the case of an 18-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis, experiencing blurriness and visual indistinctness due to issues with the left internal carotid artery. Both notes mention the patient's neurologic examination revealing oculomotor paralysis, MRI and cerebral angiography findings, and the surgical considerations and treatment plan involving stent insertion. The follow-up and plan for monitoring the patient's condition are also consistent in both notes."}}
