**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay but expresses concern about their eyes. They have experienced a 70% vision loss in the left eye and a 40% vision loss in the right eye. The patient underwent a basal cell carcinoma resection of the lower right eyelid 3 months ago, which was treated with direct closure.

**Objective:**  
The histopathology report indicated the need for a more aggressive treatment around the scar of the previous resection. The scar was not well defined, necessitating a total resection of the lower eyelid with a full-thickness resection around the scar, measuring greater than 75% of the full lower eyelid extension.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is advanced in years with severe vision loss in the contralateral eye. Due to these factors, the occlusion of the right eye and the risk of a second step operation are not ideal. The defect is too large for the advancement tarsoconjunctival flap technique.

**Plan:**  
After reviewing the bibliography, the patient is considered a good candidate for total lower eyelid reconstruction with the nasal chondromucosal flap. This approach does not require eye occlusion and allows for reconstruction in a one-step operation. Given the patient's age, the procedure will be performed under local anaesthesia with sedation, as determined by the anaesthetist.

**Discussion:**  
The patient was informed about the proposed treatment plan and the reasons for choosing this approach. The patient expressed understanding and had no questions or concerns at this time.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be seen again soon for further evaluation and to proceed with the planned surgical intervention.
