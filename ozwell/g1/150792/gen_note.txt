**Patient History:**  
The patient was treated in our clinic in 2012 for an ACL rupture sustained during a judo match. The injury occurred while the patient was in the guard position, resulting in a Lachman test score of 3+ and a KneeLax examination showing a 10-mm slippage of the affected knee compared to the unaffected one. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis of an ACL tear. The patient underwent arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons, following the procedure described in case 1.

**Postoperative Findings:**  
Postoperative CT revealed that the distance between the TR button and the exit of the tunnel on the lateral femoral cortex was 0 mm for the AM bundle and 0.5 mm for the PL bundle. Six months post-operation, the patient reported slight lateral knee pain on the TR button of the PL bundle, which was not dependent on the knee flexion angle. Despite routine rehabilitation and returning to judo, the lateral pain persisted, accompanied by slight swelling.

**Second Arthroscopy:**  
The patient opted for the removal of the TR buttons during a second arthroscopy. The TR buttons of both AM and PL bundles were removed, with the adjustable loop in the TR of the PL bundle partially worn out and easily removed. The second arthroscopic evaluation indicated that the reconstructed ACL had good synovial coverage, rigid tensioning, and the graft had been incorporated into the femoral bone tunnel. Post-removal of the TR button, the graft tensioning and incorporation remained unchanged, and the lateral knee pain immediately disappeared.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The lateral knee pain was likely due to irritation between the TR button and the lateral femoral cortex. The patient is advised to continue with regular rehabilitation and avoid activities that may cause further injury to the knee.
