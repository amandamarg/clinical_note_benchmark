Both describe the same patient's history, treatment, and postoperative findings related to an ACL rupture sustained during a judo match. They detail the initial injury, the surgical procedure of arthroscopic anatomic double-bundle reconstruction using hamstring tendons, and the postoperative complications involving lateral knee pain. Both notes mention the removal of TR buttons during a second arthroscopy, the resolution of pain, and the recommendation for continued rehabilitation. The main difference is in the wording and structure, but the content and key details are consistent across both notes."}}
