Both notes provide a detailed account of the patient's history, symptoms, diagnostic findings, surgical interventions, and histological examination results. They both mention the patient's history of adrenal gland pheochromocytomas, the discovery of a stony-hard tumor in the abdomen, and the subsequent diagnosis of extraskeletal osteosarcoma. The notes also cover the surgical resection of the tumor, the histological characteristics of the tumor, and the patient's postoperative course, including the recurrence of the tumor and eventual metastasis. Overall, the notes are very similar, with the second note providing a more concise summary of the case."}}
