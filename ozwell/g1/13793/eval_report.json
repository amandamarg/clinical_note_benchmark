Both notes mention the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the anticoagulation therapy initiated, and the patient's progress and recovery. They also outline the rehabilitation program and follow-up plan. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more structured with headings like \"Subjective,\" \"Objective,\" \"Assessment,\" and \"Plan,\" while the context information is more narrative."}}
