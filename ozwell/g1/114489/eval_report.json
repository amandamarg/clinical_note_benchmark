They both describe the case of an 18-year-old American college football player who experienced a headache after being tackled during exercise. Both notes detail the initial conservative management following a diagnosis of a simple traumatic hemorrhage, the worsening of the headache, and the occurrence of a generalized partial seizure. They describe the findings from the MRI and MRA, the emergency craniotomy performed to address the aneurysm and elevated intracranial pressure, and the discovery and removal of subdural nodules and a pseudoaneurysm. Both notes conclude with the patient's recovery without sequelae and discharge, with a plan for continued monitoring and follow-up appointments."}}
