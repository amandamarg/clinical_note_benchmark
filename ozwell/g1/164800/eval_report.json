Both notes detail the pregnancy history, obstetric evaluation, and findings from the fetal echocardiography, including the normal four-chamber view, normal atrioventricular valve movement, and the presence of a tortuous 'S' shaped ductus. They both mention the diagnosis of an S-shaped ductal arch with mild narrowing and the plan for continued monitoring. The main difference is that the second note includes additional follow-up information, such as the repeat examination at 27 weeks and the plan for continued monitoring, while the first note provides a more detailed timeline of the examinations and outcomes, including the delivery and postnatal follow-up."}}
