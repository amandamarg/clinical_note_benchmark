Both notes mention the following key points:\n\n1. The patient is asymptomatic and has a normal physical examination.\n2. An abdominal ultrasound and MRI revealed a right adrenal lesion/mass.\n3. The lesion is described as a soft tissue encapsulated mass.\n4. An endocrinological evaluation was conducted to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and check for hyper secretion of catecholamines.\n5. The plan includes considering a laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy for mass removal.\n6. The importance of patient support and education is emphasized.\n\nThe main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure and histological findings, while the second note is more of a clinical summary with a focus on the patient's subjective feelings, objective findings, assessment, and plan."}}
