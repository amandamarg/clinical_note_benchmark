**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:42:48 PM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain in the left jaw joint for the past 1.5 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ) for the past 1.5 months. The pain is exacerbated by chewing, and the patient has difficulty opening their mouth, leading to a soft diet. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diagnosed 6 months ago, and previously took homeopathy medicines for a month but is not currently on any medication.

**Review of Systems:**  
- Limited range of motion in the TMJ.
- Pain upon attempting to open the mouth wide, with deviation to the left.
- No clicking sounds during mouth opening or closing.
- Tenderness in jaw muscles upon palpation.

**Dental Examination:**  
Teeth examination revealed no abnormalities or premature contact upon biting.

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- Radiographs showed irregular erosions in the left condyle and decreased joint space bilaterally.
- TMJ tomography (open and closed mouth) indicated slight erosion on the anterior surface of the left condyle, though not clearly visible.
- Cone beam computed tomography revealed:
  - Sclerosis of the outer surface of the condylar head.
  - Narrowing of the articular space bilaterally, more pronounced on the left.
  - Coronal left closed mouth view showed loss of joint space, loss of cortical bone on the superior surface, and condylar head erosions compared to the right side, which appeared normal.
  - Coronal left open mouth view showed narrowing of the articular space and erosions on the superior head of the condyle, with no changes on the right side.
  - Sagittal view (open and closed mouth) revealed decreased joint space with erosions of the superior surface of the condyle on the left side.

**Assessment:**  
The findings suggest degenerative changes in the left TMJ, likely related to the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis.

**Plan:**  
Prescribe medication to manage pain and inflammation. Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the patient's progress.
