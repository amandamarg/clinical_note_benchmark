Both describe the case of a 75-year-old lady with a painless, slowly growing mass on the dorsum of the right wrist. They detail her past medical history, including hypertension, osteoarthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and a malunion of the right distal radius. Both notes describe the physical examination findings, laboratory and imaging studies, and the plan for biopsy and follow-up. The clinical note provides additional information about the patient's treatment and outcome, including the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the chemotherapy and radiotherapy she received, and her eventual death from a pulmonary embolism. Overall, the notes cover the same case with some differences in detail and focus."}}
