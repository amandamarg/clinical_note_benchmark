Both notes mention the conservative approach to maintain the upper front teeth using composite fillings, the restoration of the posterior superior quadrants with implants, and the replacement of residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge. They also describe the staged approach of treatment, including the extraction of lateral incisors, placement of immediate implants, use of temporary bridges, and eventual extraction of remaining teeth. The main difference is that the clinical note from 10/1/2025 includes a subjective section where the patient reports no pain besides the fracture and acknowledges teeth grinding at night, while the other note provides a more detailed account of the treatment process over the years."}}
