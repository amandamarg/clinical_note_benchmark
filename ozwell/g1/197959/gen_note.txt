**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:20:09 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Fractured central incisors, high risk for caries, eccentric bruxism, partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant, multiple decay and fractured teeth.

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with fractured central incisors but reported no pain or discomfort besides the fracture. The patient acknowledged experiencing teeth grinding at night.

**Objective:**  
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism noted.
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.
- Multiple decay and fractured teeth observed.

**Assessment:**  
The fractured teeth are likely contributed to by the patient's bruxism. The patient has a history of pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine and new and secondary subgingival caries in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay from canine to canine.

**Plan:**  
- A conservative approach will be taken to maintain the upper front teeth using composite fillings.
- Restore the posterior superior quadrants with implants.
- Replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge, similar to the prostheses of the posterior areas.
- Treatment was carried out in a staged approach:
  - Extracted the lateral incisors and placed two immediate implants.
  - Prepared the four residual teeth to be used as abutments for a temporary bridge to maintain aesthetics and function during the early osseointegration period.
  - Extracted the four remaining teeth using the SST.
  - Replaced the initial provisional bridge with the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.
  - Only one out of the four abutment teeth used for the temporization of root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.

**Outcome:**  
Unfortunately, the patient eventually passed away. Further assistance is offered to the family during this time.
