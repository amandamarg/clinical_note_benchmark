Both notes mention the patient's initial presentation with right arm pain and swelling, the diagnosis, the treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, and the complications such as thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. They also describe the patient's intractable pain, the use of opioid therapy, and the diagnostic brachial plexus block that provided temporary pain relief. The notes discuss the patient's pain characteristics, the MRI findings, and the plan for further pain management. The main difference is that the clinical note includes a family discussion about the patient's passing, which is not mentioned in the initial context."}}
