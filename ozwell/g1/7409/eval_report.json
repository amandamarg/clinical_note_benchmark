Both describe the case of a 51-year-old hypertensive Pakistani male who was admitted to the hospital with chest and back pain. They detail the findings from a CTA of the aorta, which revealed a large dissection flap and other related vascular issues. Both notes describe the thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) procedure that was performed, including the use of a stent graft and the successful outcome of the surgery. Postoperative findings and the patient's recovery are also similarly described, with both notes indicating a favorable prognosis and successful follow-up. The main difference is the format and some specific details in the presentation of the information."}}
