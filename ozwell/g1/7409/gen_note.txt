**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Chest and back pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago with complaints of chest and back pain. Prior to admission, the patient attempted to manage the pain with anti-inflammatory drugs, which were ineffective. No other symptoms were reported.

**Physical Examination:**  
Upon examination, the patient presented with stable vital signs, was conscious, and had full mobility of all limbs.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
A CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap originating from the left subclavian artery, with an enlargement of the false lumen, a mural thrombus, and compression of the true lumen. A large entry point was identified 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. An aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea. The left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. No vascular dissection or occlusion was observed below the level of the renal arteries.

**Procedure:**  
The patient underwent a thoracic endovascular repair procedure two days post-admission. The procedure was performed via the right femoral approach, with an intraoperative angiogram conducted. A stent graft measuring 34 mm Ã— 15 cm was deployed into the descending thoracic aorta, successfully covering the intimal entry tear and obliterating the false lumen.

**Post-Procedure Findings:**  
A post-deployment angiogram confirmed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point, with no perfusion of the false lumen. There was good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries, and the right and left subclavian arteries remained patent.

**Postoperative Course:**  
Following the surgery, the patient retained full limb mobility, and peripheral pulses were intact. The patient was discharged one day post-surgery and reported doing well thereafter.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient's prognosis is favorable, and they are currently doing well. No further immediate concerns were noted.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was advised to return for follow-up if any questions or concerns arise.
