They both describe the same patient's medical case, including the presentation of symptoms, diagnostic findings, surgical intervention, and postoperative course. Both notes mention the patient's history of alcohol abuse, the findings from the CT scan, the splenectomy procedure, and the postoperative complications such as agitation and elevated bilirubin levels. The notes also discuss the antibiotic therapy and the plan for follow-up. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, but the overall content and medical information are consistent between the two notes."}}
