**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Age:** [Patient Age]
- **Gender:** Female
- **Medical History:** Postmenopausal for 30 years, otherwise free medical history.

**Chief Complaint:**
- Chronic abdominal pain and weight loss.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports experiencing abdominal pain for the past six months accompanied by a weight loss of 10 kilograms. No other symptoms were noted.

**Physical Examination:**
- No tenderness observed during the physical examination.
- A hard and mobile mass was palpable in the right iliac fossa.

**Diagnostic Imaging and Findings:**
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Revealed a cystic formation in the right adnexal area with mixed solid and cystic areas. The mass had a smooth and anechoic wall. No papillary projections or septations were identified, and no blood flow was observed during the color Doppler evaluation. The left ovary measured 25 × 13 × 11 mm, while the right ovary was not visualized. A polyp of the endometrium was recorded with a total endometrial thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was seen in the Douglas pouch. The origin of the mass was inconclusive, possibly from the right adnexa or a uterine necrotic leiomyoma protruding towards the adnexa.
- **Abdominal CT Scan:** Identified a cyst sized 100 × 80 mm with signs of peripheral calcification, attributed to a lesion of the right ovary.
- **Colonoscopy:** A benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised. A submucosal round smooth cystic formation of 1 cm in diameter was identified at the site of the appendix.

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Tumor markers were within normal limits, except for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA: 54.2 ng/mL).

**Surgical Intervention:**
- The patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of a pelvic mass. A cystic tumor originating from the appendix, sized 80 × 90 mm, was identified. The uterus and ovaries were atrophic. Abdominal viscera were covered with surgical pad gauzes to protect from spillage of the cyst contents.

**Plan:**
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the patient's progress.
