They both mention the patient's initial symptoms of chest and back pain, the findings from the CTA of the aorta, the thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) procedure, and the successful outcome of the surgery. Both notes also highlight the patient's stable condition post-surgery and the plan for follow-up care. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of subjective and objective sections in the clinical note."}}
