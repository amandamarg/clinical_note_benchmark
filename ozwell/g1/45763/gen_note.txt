**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:27:08 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Right foot pain  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the right fifth toe for the past 30 years. The initial injury occurred during a sports activity, where the patient twisted the foot upon landing. At the time of injury, the patient only used a temporary bandage to address the deformity. Following the initial injury, the PIP joint of the fifth toe was redislocated several times within a 6-month period. The patient attempted the same temporary treatment each time, which proved ineffective. Over time, the fifth toe became permanently swollen and painful upon movement.  

**Current Condition:**  
Upon presentation at the clinic, the patient's fifth toe was displaced in the dorsolateral plane and swollen.  

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
A radiograph was taken, revealing a simple dislocation of the PIP joint in the dorsolateral direction, with no signs of joint destruction, erosion, or unhealed fracture.  

**Assessment:**  
The instability of the fifth toe is attributed to chronic and persistent joint subluxation, resulting in an unstable distal segment.  

**Plan:**  
The decision was made to attempt correction of the chronic dislocation via open reduction. During the procedure, the dislocated PIP joint was exposed through a dorsal incision. The joint capsule and lateral collateral ligament were dissected away from the joint space. The tight plantar plate was released from the plantar lateral aspect of the joint. The corrected position of the PIP joint was maintained by inserting a longitudinal Kirschner wire, and the lateral collateral ligament was repaired anatomically.  

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
The patient is advised to keep the foot elevated for the next few days and to take pain medication as prescribed. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for two weeks. The patient is instructed to return to the clinic if any problems arise.
