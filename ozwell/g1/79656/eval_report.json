Both notes mention the initial ACDF from C5 to C7 in 2009, the revision extension ACDF from C3 to C7 in 2010, and the subsequent complications including dysphagia and surgical site infection. They also describe the recent imaging findings of nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis, screw loosening, and concerns for esophageal perforation, leading to the decision for further surgical intervention. The notes detail the plan for hardware removal and staged revision extension from a posterior approach, as well as the findings of a pharyngeal defect with exposure of spinal hardware. Overall, the notes provide a consistent account of the patient's medical history, recent events, and planned management."}}
