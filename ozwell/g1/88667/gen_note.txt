**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:11:36 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Lower limb claudication pain and breathlessness for three years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the legs, making it difficult to walk long distances, and shortness of breath, especially when walking or climbing stairs. The patient has a past history of repair of coarctation of the aorta approximately 30 years ago via a left thoracotomy. No medical records or operative details from that operation are available.

**Imaging and Diagnostic Results:**  
An MRI scan shows a 2 cm long narrowing of the aorta just distal to the origin of an aberrant right subclavian artery. The diameter in the region of the stenosis is 1.4 cm with an additional web-like stenotic lesion at the distal end of the stenotic segment. There is evidence of calcification, possibly of an interposition tube graft used during the first operation.

**Clinical Examination:**  
Upper limb hypertension with similar blood pressures in both arms (180/100 mm Hg).

**Assessment and Plan:**  
Given the patient's symptomatic status and the findings of re-coarctation with calcification, a re-intervention is deemed appropriate. The plan is to perform a surgery via a median sternotomy to construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft. The procedure involves lifting the heart to access the descending thoracic aorta above the diaphragm and using an apical suction device to keep the empty beating heart elevated.

**Surgical Findings:**  
The sternotomy was completed uneventfully. However, the pericardial cavity was found to be obliterated with dense adhesions. A large hole in the pericardial sac was discovered with the left lung directly adherent to the heart. The adhesions were successfully released, and the surgery proceeded well.

**Postoperative Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to take it easy for a few weeks post-surgery and follow up regularly to monitor progress.

**Patient Education:**  
The procedure and findings were explained to the patient, who acknowledged understanding and agreed to the postoperative care plan.

**Follow-Up:**  
Regular follow-up appointments to be scheduled to monitor the patient's recovery and blood pressure management.
