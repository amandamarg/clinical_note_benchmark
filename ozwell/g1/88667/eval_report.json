Both describe the case of a 49-year-old gentleman with a history of coarctation of the aorta repair 30 years ago, presenting with lower limb claudication pain and breathlessness. They both mention the MRI findings of a 2 cm narrowing of the aorta distal to an aberrant right subclavian artery, with calcification and a web-like stenotic lesion. The clinical examination reveals upper limb hypertension. The plan for re-intervention via a median sternotomy to construct an extra-anatomic ascending to descending thoracic aorta bypass graft is detailed in both notes. The surgical findings of dense adhesions and a large hole in the pericardial sac are also described. Postoperative instructions and follow-up plans are included in both notes."}}
