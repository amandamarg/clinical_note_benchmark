Both describe the medical history and treatment of a 59-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia, who suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture in 2013. They both mention the retrospective observation of a CT scan revealing a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a chronic aortic dissection. Both notes detail the events of March 2020, when the patient was admitted to the emergency department for vomiting and subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). They describe the examination findings, including a pulsating abdominal mass without tenderness, and the consideration of an infectious aortic aneurysm, which was ruled out through negative screening tests and blood culture. Both notes conclude with a plan for follow-up and further management."}}
