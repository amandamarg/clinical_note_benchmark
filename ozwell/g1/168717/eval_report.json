Both describe the case of a 59-year-old female with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis, presenting with severe pain and swelling in the right arm. They detail the patient's history of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, complications such as thrombocytopenia, and the determination that she is a nonsurgical candidate. Both notes mention the patient's constant 10/10 pain, progressive weakness in the right upper extremity, and the MRI findings of a mass encasing the right brachial plexus. They also describe the diagnostic brachial plexus block performed due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain, and the subsequent management plan involving pain medication titration and interventional pain management techniques. The outcome in both notes is the patient's passing due to complications of metastatic disease progression, with an emphasis on pain management and comfort in her final days."}}
