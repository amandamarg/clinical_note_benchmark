**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Medical History:** The patient has a history of smoking for more than 30 pack-years, hypertension, and diabetes. 
- **Previous Medical Interventions:** The patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention 6 years ago due to angina.

**Current Symptoms:**
- The patient reports experiencing a cold and numbing sensation in both hands for the past 3 years.
- Two years ago, the patient experienced extreme pain (more than 90/100 mm on the visual analogue scale) and blue discoloration in the fourth finger of the left hand, which developed into an ulceration.

**Diagnosis:**
- The patient was diagnosed with Buerger's disease following tests at the orthopedic clinic.

**Treatment History:**
- The patient was referred to the pain clinic for conservative treatment one year ago.
- Angiography revealed greater than 80% stenosis in the first and third finger artery in the area of the radial artery and palmer arch, and greater than 90% stenosis in the distal ulnar artery.
- Current medications include oxycodone 40 mg twice a day, limaprost 5 Âµg, and gabapentin 300 mg three times a day.
- Despite an increase in opiate dose and the use of sympathetic and ganglion blocks, the analgesic effect was only temporary, and the pain and ulcers on the fingers worsened.

**Planned Interventions:**
- A finger amputation was initially planned as arterial bypass surgery was not a valid method for the patient.
- The patient has tried other treatments but continues to experience extreme pain (more than 90/100 mm on the VAS) and severe gangrenous ulcers progressing on the fourth finger of the left hand and the index finger of the right hand.
- The patient was very much against amputation despite the extreme pain and has been referred to the pain clinic several times.

**Final Treatment Decision:**
- The decision was made to attempt spinal cord stimulation prior to amputation.

**Procedure Plan:**
- During the spinal cord stimulation procedure, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and electrocardiography will be monitored. The patient will be in a prone position and receive local anesthesia. The patient has agreed to this plan.
