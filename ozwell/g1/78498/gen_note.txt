**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Mass in the left thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports noticing a mass in the left thigh approximately 4 months ago. An MRI evaluation revealed a subcutaneous lesion with typical features of a lipoma. A tru-cut biopsy was performed, and the report indicated a low-grade periosteal chondral tumor. A subsequent PET scan showed an apical lesion of the right lung, suspected to be a metastasis.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago.
- Underwent total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection, followed by combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
- Reoperation for metastasis of urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection. Pathology was consistent with the initial urethral adenocarcinoma diagnosis.
- Received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy post-operation.
- Developed a mass in the right thigh, suspected to be another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.
- Received 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy, followed by wide resection of the tumor. Pathology showed a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.
- Oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy but applied 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy.
- Regular follow-up for three years showed no evidence of local or systemic relapse.

**Social History:**  
The patient discontinued routine control examinations for unknown reasons.

**Current Evaluation:**  
MRI and CT angiographic evaluation of the new lesion in the left thigh showed the soft tissue component of the tumor enclosing the bone lesion 180 degrees medially and involving a 10 cm segment of the bone lesion.

**Plan:**  
Recommend follow-up tests to gain a better understanding of the current condition.

**Patient's Agreement:**  
The patient agreed to proceed with the recommended follow-up tests.
