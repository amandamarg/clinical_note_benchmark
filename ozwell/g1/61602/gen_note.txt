**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presents with a history of frequent pneumonia, which has been occurring since the age of 7.

**Past Medical History:**
- Born at 25 weeks and 6 days at home for unknown reasons.
- Birth weight: 750 g.
- Experienced cardiopulmonary arrest upon arrival at the previous hospital; resuscitation was performed immediately.
- Diagnosed with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and a gastrostomy was created at the previous hospital.
- Transferred to our institution at 28 days of age.
- Diagnosed with esophageal atresia (EA) with a distal TEF; primary repair of the EA with fistula division was performed at 5 months of age.
- Postoperative course was uneventful; gastrostomy was closed at 10 months of age.
- Discharged at 2 years of age.
- Developed severe epilepsy and encephalopathy due to encephalitis after discharge.
- Became disabled with severe mental retardation at the age of 2.
- Unable to feed orally.
- Underwent Nissen fundoplication and re-gastrostomy due to gastroesophageal reflux and hiatus hernia.
- Subglottic stenosis was suspected during the operation as intubation was only possible with a tracheal tube of 2.5mm in diameter.
- Six months post-fundoplication, a recurrence of hiatus hernia was found, involving herniation of the stomach and small and large intestine into the thoracic cavity.
- Reoperation to repair the herniation was not performed as the patient was in stable condition.
- CT scan revealed herniation of the large and small intestine into the thoracic cavity.

**Assessment and Plan:**
Based on the CT scan results, it is recommended that the large and small intestine be pulled down into the abdominal cavity to resolve the herniation issue. Further evaluation and management will be considered to address the patient's frequent pneumonia and overall condition.
