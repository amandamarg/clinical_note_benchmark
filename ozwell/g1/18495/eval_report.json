Both notes mention the patient's past medical history, including severe otitis media at age 2, multiple surgeries for cholesteatoma, recurrent meningitis, brain abscess drainage procedures, and various surgical interventions. They also discuss the patient's recent presentation with otorrhea and the suspicion of Gorham-Stout disease. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey, including specific imaging findings and the decision-making process regarding treatment, while the second note is a more concise clinical summary focusing on the chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, and assessment/plan."}}
