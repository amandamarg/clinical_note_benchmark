- First visit to our department at age 17 for controlling cholesteatoma, recurrent meningitis, and otalgia. Underwent tympanoplasty to assess the disease and remove residual cholesteatoma from the middle ear. Diagnosis confirmed by histopathological analysis.
- It was not possible to determine whether the cholesteatoma was a residual congenital cholesteatoma or a secondary cholesteatoma formed as a result of osteolysis of the external auditory canal or middle ear.
