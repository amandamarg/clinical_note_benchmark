**Chief Complaint:**  
Otorrhea in the right ear and recurrent meningitis.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with otorrhea in the right ear and a history of recurrent meningitis. The patient reports having a fever and seizures two weeks ago. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Multiple surgeries for cholesteatoma.
- Treated for severe otitis media at age 2.
- Recurrent meningitis with several brain abscess drainage procedures.
- Right temporal bone surgery at age 10.
- Diagnosed with cholesteatoma at age 16, underwent radical mastoidectomy.
- First visit to our department at age 17 for controlling cholesteatoma, recurrent meningitis, and otalgia. Underwent tympanoplasty to assess the disease and remove residual cholesteatoma from the middle ear. Diagnosis confirmed by histopathological analysis.
- Meningitis and otalgia were controlled post-tympanoplasty, but the patient experienced another episode of meningitis and an epidural abscess six months later, requiring hospitalization.
- Attended our department until age 19, then discontinued hospital visits.

**Assessment:**  
The patient's history suggests a complex case of recurrent cholesteatoma and meningitis, with previous surgical interventions and complications including brain abscesses and epidural abscess. The etiology of the cholesteatoma remains unclear, whether residual congenital or secondary due to osteolysis.

**Plan:**  
Proceed with further tests to evaluate the current status of the disease and determine appropriate management.
