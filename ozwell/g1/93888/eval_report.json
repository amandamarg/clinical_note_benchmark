They both mention the patient's age, weight, and arm span, as well as the history of scoliosis development and treatment with a spinal brace. Both notes detail the physical examination findings, including severe thoracic and lumbar scoliosis, rib hump, and waistline asymmetry, while noting normal muscle power, sensation, and reflexes. They also include radiographic findings of right thoracic scoliosis and mention the plan for follow-up treatment. However, the first note is more detailed, providing comprehensive information about the surgical intervention, postoperative care, and long-term follow-up, while the second note is a more concise summary focusing on the current status and plan."}}
