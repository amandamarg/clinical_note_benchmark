**Patient Information:**  
- **Age:** Not specified  
- **Gender:** Female  
- **Pregnancy:** 8 weeks pregnant  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Pelvic pain on the left side  
- Feeling unwell  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with complaints of left-sided pelvic pain and feeling unwell. She reported experiencing abdominal pain and feeling cold and clammy. The patient is 8 weeks pregnant and came to confirm the site of her pregnancy due to a history of a previous ectopic pregnancy.  

**Obstetric History:**  
- Previous ectopic pregnancy: Right tubal ectopic pregnancy diagnosed three years ago, treated with laparoscopic salpingectomy.  
- Previous normal pregnancies: Two normal pregnancies and deliveries before the ectopic pregnancy.  
- Current pregnancy: Spontaneous conception without the use of contraception.  

**Initial Consultation and Scan:**  
The patient was asymptomatic at the initial consultation. The scan showed an irregular gestational sac of approximately 8 weeks with a yolk sac but no fetal pole. A corpus luteal cyst was noted in the left ovary with a small amount of free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas.  

**Emergency Presentation:**  
The patient presented as an emergency with acute left-sided abdominal and pelvic pain, feeling unwell, and no vaginal bleeding.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Cold, clammy, and hypotensive  
- Abdominal examination suggestive of an acute abdomen with severe tenderness, guarding, and rigidity  

**Rescan Results:**  
The rescan revealed a left adnexal mass with a gestational sac and a fetal pole, suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy. A faint fetal heart was seen in the fetal pole, and there was a significant increase in the amount of free fluid in the pelvis compared to the previous scan.  

**Assessment:**  
The findings are indicative of an ectopic pregnancy located in the left adnexal area.  

**Plan:**  
The patient will be counseled and consent will be obtained for the next steps in management.
