They both describe the same clinical scenario involving a 93-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room with an inability to pass urine due to a large rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) causing bladder outlet obstruction. Both notes detail the patient's medical history, examination findings, investigations, management, and follow-up. The main difference is in the format and some minor details, but the core information and sequence of events are consistent across both notes."}}
