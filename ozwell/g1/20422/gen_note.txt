**Time:** 8:17:31 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Karnofsky Performance Index:** 40  
- **Medical History:** Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation  
- **Medications:** Oral Coumadin  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Inability to pass urine for one day.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of inability to pass urine for a day. The patient reports feeling weak and resides in an assisted living facility. The care provider noted the absence of urine output for a day.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital signs: Within normal limits  
- Abdominal examination: Palpable mass, globular and firm in consistency  

**Investigations:**  
- Blood work: Anemia with hemoglobin of 6 g/dL, elevated INR of 4.5  
- CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast: Large grade 3 rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) extending into the pelvis, causing compressive symptoms over the bladder outlet. No evidence of contrast extravasation in the hematoma.

**Management and Hospital Course:**  
- Immediate transfusion of packed red blood cells to maintain hemoglobin >8 g/dL  
- Held Coumadin and reversed INR with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K  
- Foley catheter placed to relieve bladder outlet obstruction  
- Over the subsequent day, hemoglobin remained stable, and the patient was able to make urine  
- Due to poor performance index and high risk for surgery, a 14 French catheter was placed in the hematoma  
- Over subsequent days, clinical examination revealed a reduction in the size of the abdominal hematoma  
- Foley catheter removed four days post-procedure, and the patient was able to void independently  

**Discharge and Follow-up:**  
The patient was discharged from the hospital. At the two-week follow-up, the patient still has a swelling, which is smaller in size. Continued monitoring is planned to ensure it is not causing any problems.
