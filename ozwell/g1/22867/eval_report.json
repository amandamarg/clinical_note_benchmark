Both notes mention the patient's initial symptoms, treatment with oral prednisolone and IVIG (referred to as a \"special protein drip\" in the second note), and the subsequent diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They also highlight the importance of psychological support and the role of a multidisciplinary team in managing the patient's condition. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific wording used in each note."}}
