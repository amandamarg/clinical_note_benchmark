**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:31:45 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling weak and experiencing shortness of breath. Additional symptoms include trouble speaking and swallowing, and nasal discharge when drinking fluids. These symptoms began a few weeks ago and have been progressively worsening.

**Objective:**  
The patient was previously admitted to the pediatric ward for these symptoms. The anesthetic service reviewed the patient, and they were under close surveillance. No invasive procedures were performed. The patient was started on oral prednisolone and a special protein drip. 

**Assessment:**  
The patient made good progress and was discharged with a plan for another course of the protein drip in 4 weeks. Upon follow-up 12 months later, the patient was on maximum alternate day steroids and receiving the protein drip every 4 weeks. The patient reported a dramatic response to the protein drip, but noted that the effect wore off after about 3 weeks, with symptoms, particularly fatigue, returning. During examination, no weakness was observed, but the patient expressed reliving the initial hospital admission and attributed survival to the protein drip. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and appropriate psychological supports were implemented. 

**Plan:**  
The protein drip was withheld, and a gradual improvement in symptoms was observed. The case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary team in managing young patients with juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG). 

**Follow-up:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's progress and adjust treatment as necessary. Ensure ongoing psychological support for PTSD.
