**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:18:26 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Chest and leg pain following a motor vehicle accident.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident, losing control of the car and colliding with a house. The patient did not lose consciousness during the accident.  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Decreased breath sounds over the right hemithorax.  
- Increased respiratory rate.  
- Crepitus over the right clavicle.  
- Deformity in the right thigh.  
- Neurologic and vascular examinations of extremities were normal.  

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- Right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement.  
- Partial pneumothorax confirmed by radiographic analysis and CT imaging.  
- Displaced femoral shaft fracture.  

**Procedures and Treatment:**  
- Thoracostomy tube inserted into the right pleural cavity and placed under suction to inflate the lung.  
- Sling applied for clavicle fracture to allow access to the thoracostomy site.  
- Intramedullary nailing of the femur with a centromedullary device performed without complication on the day of injury.  
- Open reduction with internal fixation of the clavicle fracture performed 2 days after stabilizing the femur fracture due to the magnitude of displacement and associated partial pneumothorax.  

**Discussion:**  
The patient was informed about the orthopedic and cardiopulmonary risks of surgery. Due to the difficulty in achieving union with nonoperative methods and the partial pneumothorax, an open reduction was indicated after a closed reduction was unsuccessful.  

**Current Status:**  
The patient reports some pain, but it is improved compared to before the procedures.  

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and provide further instructions as needed.
