**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports a history of pre-eclampsia with severe features during her second pregnancy, leading to a cesarean delivery at 32 weeks gestation due to uncontrollable blood pressures. She has a history of endometriosis and infertility, with both pregnancies conceived via in vitro fertilization by frozen embryo transfer. 

**Objective:**  
- First pregnancy was uncomplicated, but a primary cesarean section was performed for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing. No pelvic pathology was noted during that cesarean section.
- During the second pregnancy, a right ovarian mass was diagnosed while on IVF treatment. The patient declined removal of the mass due to potential damage to nearby ovarian tissue and worsening infertility.
- Early pregnancy transvaginal ultrasonography suspected the mass as endometrioma or desmoid tumor. The mass was kept under surveillance with periodic ultrasound imaging.
- In the second trimester, due to changes in mass characteristics and size, the patient was referred to a Gynecologic Oncologist. The recommendation was to follow the mass with sequential ultrasound and remove it at the time of repeat cesarean section, provided the mass did not change in size or configuration and the patient remained asymptomatic.
- At 32 weeks gestation, the patient developed pre-eclampsia with severe features and was admitted. She received magnesium sulfate infusion for seizure prophylaxis and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity.
- Maternal-Fetal-Medicine specialists recommended delivery at 34 weeks unless new signs of maternal or fetal instability occurred.
- Three days post-admission, an emergency cesarean section was performed due to recurrent severe blood pressure changes unresponsive to intravenous antihypertensive medications.
- During the cesarean section, extensive adhesions were noted at the level of adipose tissue, rectus muscle, and anterior surface of the uterus, which were densely adhered to.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Monitor and manage post-operative recovery.
- Continue surveillance of the right ovarian mass.
- Follow-up with Gynecologic Oncologist for further management of the ovarian mass.
- Monitor blood pressure and manage any hypertensive episodes.
- Schedule follow-up appointments to assess recovery and plan further treatment as necessary.
