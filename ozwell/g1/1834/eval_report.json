Both describe the case of a 77-year-old female with a sensitive mass on her right wrist, which has been present and worsening over three years. They mention hypersensitivity to light contact, occasional radiating pain, and no cold sensitivity. Both notes include the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), as well as the lack of relief from a stellate ganglion block. The physical exam findings, imaging results, and assessment of a neuroma are consistent in both notes. The plan for surgical excision and the postoperative satisfaction and diagnosis of a glomus tumor are also described in both notes. The main difference is the format and some minor variations in wording, but the content and clinical details are essentially the same."}}
