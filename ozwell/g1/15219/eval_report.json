Both notes detail the patient's sudden onset of left eyelid ptosis, history of hypertension, findings from the CTA examination, and the events following the cerebral angiography, including the subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequent treatments. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey."}}
