**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:32:06 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden onset of left eyelid ptosis for 1 day.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reported waking up with a drooping left eyelid without any known cause. The patient has a history of hypertension but does not regularly measure blood pressure or take antihypertensive medication.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Consciousness: Clear  
- Speech: Normal  
- Left Eye: Eyelid drooping, pupil diameter 5 mm, absent light reflex, inability to move the eyeball  
- Right Eye: Normal  
- Limb Muscle Strength and Tension: Normal  

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- CTA examination revealed bilateral internal carotid artery aneurysms.  
- Whole cerebral angiography was performed under local anesthesia, which proceeded smoothly.  
- Imaging diagnosis showed bilateral carotid artery communicating aneurysm with severe stenosis of the origin of the left carotid artery.  
  - Left aneurysm: 8 mm × 3 mm, neck 3 mm  
  - Right aneurysm: 3.7 mm × 3.8 mm, neck 3.8 mm  

**Clinical Course:**  
Post-angiography, the patient became unconscious with bilateral pupil dilation (5 mm), absence of light reflex, and no reaction to stabbing pain in limbs. An emergency head CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient was treated with an intravenous injection of 20% mannitol solution 250 mL, regaining consciousness and autonomous limb movement approximately 15 minutes later.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Considered rupture of the left posterior communicating artery aneurysm.  
- Due to the patient's older age and poor general physical condition, conservative treatment was chosen over surgical intervention.  
- The patient's condition improved gradually by the third day post-operation.  
- Continued monitoring and treatment adjustments as necessary.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely, and treatment will be adjusted based on the patient's condition. The patient is advised to communicate any questions or concerns.
