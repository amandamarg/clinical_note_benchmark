Both describe the findings from the dissection of a 91-year-old female cadaver who had Alzheimer's disease. They detail the discovery of an enlarged gallbladder with a transverse partial septation, the enlargement of the biliary duct system, and the presence of vascular anomalies such as an aberrant right hepatic artery and an accessory left hepatic artery. Both notes also mention the hypothesis that the septal abnormality was congenital and may have caused symptoms of biliary colic during the patient's life. Additionally, they conjecture that the patient may have passed a gallstone prior to death, leading to the dilation of the biliary tree. The main difference is that the clinical note includes a plan to communicate the findings to the patient's family."}}
