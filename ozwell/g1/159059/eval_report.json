Both notes mention a 5-year-old female patient with a swelling on the right side of the face present since birth, which has increased over time. They both note the presence of pain due to a carious right mandibular deciduous second molar and mention the asymmetry and hypertrophy on the right side of the face and tongue. Diagnostic tests in both notes reveal accelerated development and root formation of teeth on the right side, and imaging studies suggest a benign soft tissue mass with features of hemifacial hyperplasia and lipomatosis-like lesion. The main difference is in the structure and detail of the notes, with the first note providing more detailed imaging findings and the second note summarizing the clinical assessment and plan."}}
