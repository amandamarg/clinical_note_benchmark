Both notes detail the patient's history, the unsuccessful previous attempts to close the fistula, and the decision to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to address the defect. They outline the surgical plan, including the excision of the fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, and the mobilization and rotation of the submandibular gland to fill the defect. The notes also mention the post-operative care and follow-up instructions. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure and its outcome, while the second note is a clinical note summarizing the patient's condition, assessment, and planned surgical approach."}}
