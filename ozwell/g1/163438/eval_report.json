Both describe the case of a 55-year-old female patient who is experiencing a burning sensation in the mouth, redness, difficulty sensing temperature changes, and recurrent infections due to her current acrylic dentures. They both mention that the patient is undergoing treatment for menopausal symptoms and has been edentulous for 2 years, with symptoms occurring for the past year. The treatment plan in both notes involves fabricating a complete denture with a customized metal palate design to alleviate the symptoms. The procedure details, including the use of irreversible hydrocolloid for the primary impression and zinc oxide eugenol for the secondary impression, are also consistent across both notes."}}
