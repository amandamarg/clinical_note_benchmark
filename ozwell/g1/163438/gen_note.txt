**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Age:** [Patient's Age]  
**Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient reports experiencing a burning sensation in the mouth, particularly in the front part, along with frequent redness. The patient also notes difficulty sensing the temperature of food and recurrent infections, both allergic and microbial, associated with current dentures.

**Medical History:**  
The patient is currently undergoing treatment for menopausal symptoms with a gynecologist.

**Dental History:**  
The patient has been edentulous for 2 years and has been experiencing the aforementioned symptoms for the past year.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
After reviewing the patient's case, we have decided to fabricate a complete denture to alleviate the symptoms. The burning sensation may be attributed to contact sensitivity to the denture base materials or allergens and microbial antigens on the acrylic denture plate.

The proposed treatment involves creating a customized metal palate design. This design will include metal loops positioned in specific directions to enhance interlocking with the acrylic portion without interfering with the arrangement of artificial teeth.

**Procedure Details:**  
1. A primary impression will be made using irreversible hydrocolloid.
2. A custom tray will be fabricated for the secondary impression, which will be made with zinc oxide eugenol.
3. The final cast will be duplicated, and a refractory cast will be formed for the fabrication of the customized metal palate.
4. A sheet of green spacer wax will be placed on the palatal portion of the cast, covering the crest of the ridge and extending 2-3 mm beyond it.
5. Loops of 2-3 mm length will be attached to the peripheral border of the previously adapted palatal spacer wax, ensuring they are 2-3 mm short of the sulcus to enhance acrylic interlocking.
6. Tiny loops will also be placed slightly palatal to the crest.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return in a few weeks for a follow-up to ensure proper fitting of the denture and to assess if any adjustments are necessary.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient was informed to return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks. They were encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
