**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Nonverbal communication following carbon monoxide poisoning.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has a history of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The incident occurred during a hurricane-related power failure when a generator was running in the family's connected garage. The patient was found unconscious on the couch along with other family members, some of whom did not survive the CO poisoning. Emergency personnel transported the patient to a shock trauma center.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon arrival at the shock trauma center, the patient was intubated due to their level of consciousness. A CT scan of the head showed no signs of obvious pathology. A chest X-ray revealed a small focal consolidation on the lower right lobe and mild bilateral calcification suggesting pulmonary edema. The patient was taken to a hyperbaric oxygen chamber the day after admission. An MRI indicated some evidence of anoxic brain injury, with diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema involving the bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. The patient was later extubated and, by the time of discharge, was able to follow some simple commands and pass a PO diet, although they remained nonverbal.

**Discharge and Rehabilitation:**  
The patient was discharged after nine days to an inpatient brain injury rehabilitation facility when believed to be stable. Upon admission to the rehabilitation facility, the patient was arousable for short periods and able to respond to yes-no questions with a head nod.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is nonverbal but can communicate through head nods. They have a history of anoxic brain injury secondary to carbon monoxide poisoning, with evidence of diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema.

**Plan:**  
Continue rehabilitation efforts focusing on improving communication and cognitive function. Monitor the patient's progress and adjust the rehabilitation plan as necessary.
