They both mention the circumstances of the CO exposure, the patient's initial unresponsiveness, and the subsequent medical interventions, including intubation, imaging studies, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Both notes also discuss the patient's discharge to a rehabilitation facility and the focus on rehabilitation efforts. However, the second note provides a more concise summary and focuses on the patient's nonverbal communication and rehabilitation plan."}}
