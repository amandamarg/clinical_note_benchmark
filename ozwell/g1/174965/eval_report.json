Both notes mention the initial occurrence of facial palsy at the age of three, subsequent episodes, and the treatment with corticosteroids. They also detail the diagnosis of pure red cell hypoplasia, the suspected involvement of anti-EPO antibodies, and the autoimmune hypothesis. Additionally, both notes describe the imaging findings of a haemorrhagic stroke during the second episode of facial palsy and the treatment plan involving corticosteroids and vitamin B supplementation. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative, while the second note is a structured clinical note summarizing the patient's information, history, and treatment plan."}}
