**Chief Complaint:**
- Left peripheral facial palsy

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presents with left peripheral facial palsy, characterized by an inability to close the left eye and drooping of the mouth's corner. The patient has a history of facial nerve palsy, with the first occurrence at the age of three years and one month, which was treated with corticosteroids and completely regressed.

**Past Medical History:**
- **Facial Nerve Palsy:** 
  - First episode at 3 years and 1 month, treated with corticosteroids.
  - Second episode at 4 years and 4 months, accompanied by an acute onset of strength deficit on the left side of the body. Imaging showed a haemorrhagic stroke in the anterior portion of the right putamen and external capsule with perilesional oedema, involving the anterior limb of the internal capsule. High diastolic blood pressure was noted during hospitalization. Symptoms regressed completely three weeks after onset.
  - Third episode at 5 years and 6 months, treated with corticosteroids with symptom regression.

- **Pure Red Cell Hypoplasia:** Diagnosed at 3 years and 9 months, presenting with severe anaemia and an extreme lack of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Haemoglobin was 3.00 g/dL and red blood cells were 1,000,000/mmÂ³. Likely caused by anti-EPO antibodies, with the autoimmune hypothesis postulated on empirical bases.

**Medications:**
- Corticosteroids (for facial palsy episodes)

**Plan:**
- Follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the patient's condition and ensure continued recovery.
