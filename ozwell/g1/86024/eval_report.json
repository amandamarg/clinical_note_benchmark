Both notes mention the patient's difficulty in holding their head up, the ability to correct the deformity manually, and the impact on daily life. They also include similar objective findings such as degenerative changes in the cervical spine, myopathic changes in neck muscles, and normal routine laboratory studies. The assessment in both notes confirms the diagnosis of isolated neck extensor myopathy. The plan in both notes advises wearing a cervical collar and discusses the potential for progressive weakness. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the patient's medical history, surgical interventions, and outcomes over several years, while the second note is a clinical summary focusing on the current condition and management plan."}}
