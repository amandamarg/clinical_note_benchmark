**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing difficulty with neck control, specifically an inability to hold their head up, which drops towards the chest. This issue began approximately five months ago, initially presenting as mild difficulty but has since worsened. The patient can only hold their head up for about five minutes with extreme effort and can correct the deformity manually, though it is a struggle. The deformity resolves when lying down but returns upon sitting up. The patient denies any other weakness in extremities or difficulties in chewing and swallowing. The condition has significantly impacted daily life, requiring the patient to hold their head with their left hand while eating and reducing outdoor activities due to discomfort with wearing a collar.

**Objective:**  
- Neurological examination: Normal parameters.
- Cervical spine radiographs: Degenerative changes and flexion deformity observed.
- MRI: Cervical spondylotic changes with mild compression of the spinal cord.
- Neurophysiological evaluation with needle electromyography: Myopathic changes in neck muscles.
- Open biopsy of paravertebral muscles: Muscle fibers of variable size or atrophic, compatible with myopathy.
- Routine laboratory studies: Serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase normal.
- Thyroid function tests, parathyroid hormone, acetylcholine receptor antibodies, and tumor markers: Negative.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is diagnosed with isolated neck extensor myopathy, confirmed through neurophysiological evaluation and muscle biopsy.

**Plan:**  
- Advise wearing a cervical collar to improve neck posture and social interactions, despite the patient's reluctance.
- Discuss the potential for mild but progressive weakness in all extremities over the next two years, with anticipated difficulty in fine motor tasks such as buttoning or unbuttoning.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to monitor the patient's condition and provide ongoing support.

**Discussion:**  
The patient has declined surgical intervention. Emphasis was placed on the importance of wearing a cervical collar, as it may aid in improving posture and social engagement. The patient expressed concerns about wearing the collar consistently, as noted by the spouse's observation of infrequent use. The patient was reassured of continued support and management of symptoms.
