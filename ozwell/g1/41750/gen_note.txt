**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and restricted movement in the right shoulder.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports significant pain in the right shoulder with an inability to move it without discomfort. The symptoms began after discharge from a previous hospital admission where the patient was treated for head injuries sustained during an assault four weeks ago. The patient was hospitalized for 16 days and was advised to seek an orthopaedic consultation upon discharge, which was not pursued.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Right shoulder: Reasonably maintained contour.
- Total restriction of abduction.
- Internal rotation possible up to 20Â°.
- External rotation not possible.

**Assessment:**  
Radiographs confirm a fractured proximal humerus with a dislocated head.

**Plan:**  
- Recommend open reduction and reconstruction of the proximal humerus.
- Procedure involves general anaesthesia, accessing the glenohumeral joint via a deltopectoral approach, removal of granulation tissue, clearing callus from the glenoid cavity and proximal humerus, and shortening the distal fragment by 2 cm for reduction beneath the head.
- Post-procedure follow-up with physical therapy to regain full shoulder movement.

**Patient's Consent:**  
The patient is comfortable with the proposed procedure and consents to proceed.

**Follow-Up:**  
Schedule the procedure as soon as possible and arrange for subsequent physical therapy sessions.
