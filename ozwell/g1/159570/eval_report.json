Both describe the patient's history of throbbing pain in the upper left canine tooth following orthognathic surgery, the presence of a root injury with potential endodontic involvement, and a periodontal pocket with significant probing depth. They also mention the patient's resistance to tooth removal, the occurrence of a periodontal abscess with a draining sinus, and the rapid resorption of the root area with alveolar bone loss. Both notes outline the proposed treatment plan involving Modified Widman flap surgery and restoration with glass ionomer cement, as well as the patient's consent to the treatment. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and structured into subjective, objective, assessment, plan, patient education, and follow-up sections."}}
