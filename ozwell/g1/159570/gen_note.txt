**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:01:24 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing a throbbing pain in the upper left canine tooth. The pain has been intermittent for about a year, beginning after orthognathic surgery on the upper maxilla. The patient denies any other symptoms besides the pain.

**Objective:**  
Upon examination, the patient exhibits pain on vertical and lateral percussions of the upper left canine tooth. A radiograph reveals a root injury in the middle third of the root with potential endodontic involvement. There is a periodontal pocket with a 9mm probing depth in the distal area of the tooth. The patient had previously undergone root canal treatment, which relieved acute symptoms and rendered the periodontal pocket inactive. However, the patient did not attend the periodontal review. Currently, the patient presents with a painful periodontal abscess and a draining sinus opening related to the periapex of the same tooth. The radiograph indicates rapid resorption of the root area at the lesion's border, with significant alveolar bone loss surrounding it.

**Assessment:**  
1. Persistent pain in the upper left canine tooth post-orthognathic surgery.
2. Root injury with potential endodontic involvement.
3. Periodontal pocket with significant probing depth.
4. Periodontal abscess with draining sinus.
5. Rapid resorption of root area and alveolar bone loss.

**Plan:**  
The patient is resistant to tooth removal and prefers to preserve natural teeth. Modified Widman flap surgery, along with restoration of the root lesion using glass ionomer cement, is proposed. The patient is informed of the possibility of treatment failure due to root fracture and recurrence of the pocket from non-adaptation of gingival tissue on the restorative surface. To manage the inflammatory status of the gingiva and drain the abscess, a closed curettage of the pocket followed by subgingival irrigation will be performed. The patient consents to the proposed treatment plan, and the procedure will be scheduled.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was educated on the nature of the periodontal pocket, the significance of the bone loss, and the proposed treatment plan, including potential risks and outcomes. The patient understands and agrees to proceed with the treatment.

**Follow-Up:**  
Schedule the procedure for the patient and monitor the healing process post-operatively.
