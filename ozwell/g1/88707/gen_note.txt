**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Location:** The Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with worsening pain in the left breast and chest wall. She reports a recurrent palpable mass in the inferior aspect of the left breast, which has been causing significant pain. The patient has a history of three separate left breast biopsies. The first biopsy, conducted seven years ago at an outside community hospital, showed dense fibrous stroma with fibrocystic changes. Four years ago, a second biopsy revealed hyperplastic fibrosis, consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. One year ago, a third biopsy again showed findings consistent with fibromatosis of the breast. The patient's surgeon previously informed her that the tumor was benign and no further action was necessary. However, the patient has experienced persistent and worsening pain, palpable tenderness, and an increasing sized palpable mass in the same region since the last biopsy.

**Objective:**  
Clinical examination revealed volume loss in the left breast.

**Assessment:**  
Test results indicate the presence of cancer.

**Plan:**  
The patient was informed of the diagnosis and the need to start treatment as soon as possible. Appointments will be scheduled with a specialist to initiate treatment. The patient will be provided with instructions on necessary actions to take in the meantime.
