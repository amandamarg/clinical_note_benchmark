Both describe the medical situation of a 46-year-old man with diabetes who presented with right foot pain and fever, and both detail the surgical history and plan involving a tibial IM nail and below-knee amputation. They mention the patient's arterial occlusion, previous disarticulations, and the decision to perform a below-knee amputation while removing the tibial IM nail. The notes also cover the surgical plan, patient education, and follow-up care. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed surgical procedure description, while the second note is a clinical summary by Dr. Smith."}}
