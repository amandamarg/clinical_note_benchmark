**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with right foot pain and fever.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient, who has a history of diabetes, reports experiencing pain and fever in the right foot for the past few days. The patient was previously diagnosed with arterial occlusion in the right lower extremity as a complication of diabetes. The patient underwent disarticulations in the right second and third metatarsophalangeal joint in the plastic surgery department of our hospital. However, the infection and necrosis in the right foot worsened, necessitating additional surgery.

**Surgical History:**  
The patient was referred to the orthopedic surgery department following the insertion of a tibial IM nail. Amputations were considered as surgical options, but it was determined that the blood flow to the distal part of the popliteal artery was intact, and the infection and necrosis had not progressed beyond the foot. Based on the physical examination, the skin color of the right calf appeared healthy. Therefore, it was decided to remove the tibial IM nail and perform a below-knee amputation.

**Surgical Plan:**  
Due to the high possibility of complications from additional surgery around the knee joint to remove the tibial IM nail, it was planned to remove the amputated limb and IM nail simultaneously by performing an amputation with the nail fixed on the ankle by distal locking screws. The tibial bone cutting level was determined by referring to the lateral view of the tibial plain radiograph. The tibial IM nail is designed with an anterior angulation in the proximal part. To ensure the nail could be removed from the proximal part of the tibia, tibial bone cutting was planned at the point of the anterior angulation in the nail to preserve as much of the tibia as possible.

**Plan:**  
The patient will undergo the planned surgical procedure, and post-operative care will be provided to ensure a smooth recovery. Further details will be explained to the patient after the surgery.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the surgical plan and the reasons for the chosen approach. The patient acknowledged understanding of the procedure and the associated risks.

**Follow-Up:**  
Post-operative follow-up will be scheduled to monitor recovery and address any complications.
