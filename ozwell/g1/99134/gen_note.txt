**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:40:06 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient was admitted with recurrent dyskinesia episodes. Symptoms include intermittent twisting of limbs, occurring on either the right or left side, starting from the leg to the arm, and sometimes affecting both the arm and leg simultaneously. Episodes last from hours to days and occur more than four times a week, during which the patient is unable to move and experiences crying. The patient also has a history of hemiplegic episodes and convulsions, with normal developmental milestones in childhood. Hemiplegic events reoccurred upon entering elementary school, triggered by nervousness or new environments, affecting alternating sides or all four extremities, lasting hours to days, and recurring several times a week. Due to frequent episodes, the patient was unable to complete elementary school but did not experience mental retardation. No growth or cognitive abnormalities have been noted into adulthood. Prior to visiting the clinic, episodes manifested once a month, lasting three days to two weeks, with characteristics similar to those during elementary school age. The patient can live normally without cognitive dysfunction when episodes are absent and does not experience loss of consciousness during attacks.

- **Family History:** The patient's cousin was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and died in her twenties.

- **Neurological Examination:** Initial examination revealed motor weakness in upper and lower extremities, with a Medical Research Council grade of IV- and III.

**Plan:** Schedule follow-up tests to determine the cause of symptoms and develop a treatment plan. The patient has agreed to proceed with the tests.
