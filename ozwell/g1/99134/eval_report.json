Both notes mention the onset of symptoms after the patient's first birthday, the nature of the episodes affecting limbs, the frequency and duration of episodes, and the impact on the patient's life, such as being unable to complete elementary school. They also both note the absence of cognitive dysfunction outside of episodes and the family history of a cousin with cerebral palsy. Additionally, both notes include details about neurological examinations and previous treatments attempted. The main difference is that the clinical note dated 10/1/2025 provides a more concise summary of the patient's history and current plan for follow-up tests."}}
