They both describe the medical history and current condition of a 60-year-old male patient with a history of liver cirrhosis and previous injuries to the left leg. Both notes mention the patient's tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago, sciatic nerve injury, and subsequent distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture 8 years later. They describe the patient's current symptoms of pain, swelling, and erythematous changes in the left leg, as well as the limited motion and sensory reduction due to the sciatic nerve injury. The notes also detail the physical examination findings, radiographic investigations, and the development of a draining sinus with discharge of thick fluid. Both notes conclude with the unfortunate outcome of the patient's passing."}}
