**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and previous injuries to the left leg, including a tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago with open reduction and internal fixation, and a sciatic nerve injury. Eight years later, the patient sustained a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture, treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and stent insertion in the femoral artery.

**Presenting Complaint:**
- Pain and swelling in the left leg, with erythematous changes on the anterolateral aspect.

**History of Present Illness:**
- Symptoms began a month ago without specific trauma. The patient reported limited motion in the ankle and toes and sensory reduction in the foot due to the previous sciatic nerve injury.

**Physical Examination:**
- Erythematous changes localized to the anterior aspect of the left leg, forming a fluid-filled, erythematous mass.
- Ankle dorsiflexion was 0 degrees, and plantar flexion was 5 degrees. All toes exhibited clawing deformity.
- Motor strength: Ankle dorsiflexion grade 0, plantar flexion grade 3.
- Sensation: No sensation in the first web space and medial aspect of the foot, with sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.

**Investigations:**
- Radiographs showed a widespread radiopaque mass on the left leg.
- A draining sinus developed on the erythematous mass, discharging thick fluid with chalk-like material.
- Angiography revealed obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation.
- Radiographs from 10 years ago indicated a mass that developed over time.

**Outcome:**
- The patient unfortunately passed away.
