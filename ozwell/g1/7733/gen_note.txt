**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:38:40 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Elective left total knee arthroplasty  

**History:**  
The patient presents with a history of lupus and osteoarthritis, reporting worsening symptoms. The patient previously underwent knee reconstruction 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system, with the tibial WasherLoc removed approximately 10 years post-surgery.

**Surgical Details:**  
- The patient was positioned supine, and a standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was made.
- A measured resection was performed, and an intramedullary guide was placed in the femur.
- The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation, and a size 4 femoral prosthesis was initially placed. However, it overhung both medially and laterally on the condyles, necessitating a downsizing of the femoral component.
- The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was reapplied, revealing contact with the bone mulch ACL screw. The screw was located in the lateral femoral condyle, cleared with a curette, and removed.
- The proximal tibia was prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope, and a size 3 tibial component with a 9 mm poly was placed. The knee was tight in both flexion and extension, leading to an additional 2 mm resection on the proximal tibia.

**Complications:**  
- During the trial of the prostheses, a fracture of the lateral femoral condyle was noted. An attempt was made to convert to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis. The femoral canal was reamed, and the femoral box cut was made. However, a fracture of the medial femoral condyle was subsequently noted.
- An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were reamed.

**Plan:**  
The surgery could not be completed today due to the lack of proper implants. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled as soon as possible to proceed with the surgery once the appropriate implants are available.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient was advised to contact the office with any questions or concerns. Further instructions will be provided once the follow-up appointment is scheduled.
