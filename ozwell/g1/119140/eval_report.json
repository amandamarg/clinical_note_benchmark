Both describe the same patient case, focusing on a 75-year-old man with osteoarthritis of the right knee and bilateral painless swollen calf muscles. They both mention the conservative treatment with steroid infiltration for the knee pain and the decision to manage the venous malformations conservatively due to their asymptomatic nature. The physical examination findings, MRI results, and the plan for follow-up are consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the format and slight variations in wording, but the clinical content and conclusions are essentially the same."}}
