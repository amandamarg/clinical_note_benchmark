**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:55:53 PM  

**Patient History:**
The patient presents with an inability to walk, reporting a long history of osteomalacia. The patient has been unable to walk for the last 4 years due to severe weakness and pain in the bones. The condition reportedly started in infancy, with delayed walking until 2.5 years of age and an inability to run during school years. The patient did not seek medical help initially due to financial constraints.

**Pregnancy and Delivery:**
The patient married at 15 and became pregnant soon after. During pregnancy, the patient experienced difficulty walking and leg pain, requiring assistance to rise from a sitting position. A cesarean section was recommended due to a contracted pelvis, but the patient delivered vaginally and sustained a fracture of the pubic rami during delivery.

**Progression:**
Over the years, the patient's condition worsened, with increased difficulty walking and climbing stairs, eventually becoming bedridden. The patient was diagnosed with osteomalacia by several orthopedic surgeons and was treated with calcium, vitamin D, and calcitriol (0.25 mg daily for short periods), but saw no improvement and discontinued treatment.

**Neurological Evaluation:**
The patient was evaluated by a neurologist, who found a normal nerve conduction study and no evidence of neurological disease.

**Family History:**
There is no family history of osteomalacia or similar conditions in the patient's parents, siblings, or other relatives.

**Physical Examination:**
Upon initial presentation to the clinic, the patient was 144 cm tall and weighed 49 kg, significantly shorter than other family members.

**Assessment:**
The patient's history and examination are consistent with osteomalacia. Further tests will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan:**
The patient is advised to follow up for further instructions and management based on test results.
