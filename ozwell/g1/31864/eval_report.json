Both describe a 24-year-old Yemeni female with a long history of osteomalacia, inability to walk for the last 4 years, severe weakness, and bone pain. They detail her delayed walking in infancy, difficulty during pregnancy, and progression to being bedridden. Both notes mention her treatment with calcium, vitamin D, and calcitriol without improvement, and a normal neurological evaluation. They also note the absence of a family history of similar conditions and her physical examination findings. The main difference is the date and time of the notes, with the clinical note being more recent."}}
