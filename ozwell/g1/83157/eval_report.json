Both describe the case of a 56-year-old female patient who was admitted due to retroorbital pain and mild visual deterioration. They detail the discovery of a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the internal carotid artery (ICA) on the right side, the treatment considerations involving flow diverters (FDs), and the subsequent procedure of placing a Pipeline FD. Both notes also describe the post-procedure complications, including acute visual acuity deterioration, left-sided hemiparesis, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), as well as the final treatment involving a double-barrel extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass. The main difference is that the clinical note includes specific details such as the patient's name, date, and physician, while the other note is more of a narrative summary."}}
