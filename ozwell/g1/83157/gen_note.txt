**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Retroorbital pain and mild visual deterioration in both eyes.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of retroorbital pain and mild visual deterioration in both eyes. An ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral constriction of the visual field and a slight reduction in visual acuity on the right side. Further tests, including a magnetic resonance of the brain and a digital subtraction angiography, identified a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the internal carotid artery (ICA) on the right side.

**Treatment Consideration:**  
The treatment option considered was the use of flow diverters (FDs), despite the lack of randomized evidence showing superiority over conventional treatment options. The paraclinoid ICA was deemed an ideal target for such devices, with no anatomical limitations to correct deployment. The goal was to induce aneurysm shrinkage to relieve the mass effect on the optic pathways.

**Procedure:**  
The ophthalmic aneurysm was initially loosely coiled, followed by the placement of a Pipeline FD in the parent artery across the aneurysm neck. The FD was well deployed, with the landing zone extending from the supraclinoid ICA to the cavernous ICA. There was mild focal narrowing at the distal ring where the ICA was compressed by the aneurysm against the clinoid process.

**Post-Procedure Course:**  
Post-procedure, the patient experienced acute deterioration of visual acuity on both sides despite corticosteroid treatment. The patient was discharged home after 7 days on double antiplatelet medication, specifically 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin per day.

**Follow-Up and Complications:**  
Three months post-procedure, the patient acutely developed left-sided hemiparesis lasting 48 hours, followed by transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). A digital subtraction angiography (DSA) disclosed thrombosis of the FD with occlusion of the ICA. Despite resumption of antiplatelet medications, adequate hydration, and thorough blood pressure monitoring to prevent hypotension, the patient continued to suffer from multiple TIAs. A perfusion-weighted CT scan demonstrated a significant increase in mean transit time and a reduction in cerebral blood flow on the right side.

**Final Treatment:**  
The patient underwent a [Doctor explains the final treatment]. 

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment as necessary to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.
