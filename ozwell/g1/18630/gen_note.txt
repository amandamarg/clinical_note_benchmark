**Chief Complaint:**
Heavy bleeding post-delivery.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient is a postpartum female who presented with heavy bleeding that began approximately 6 days after giving birth to her baby. This was her third pregnancy and second delivery. The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, and her baby weighed 3500 grams at birth. Despite medical therapies, the bleeding was uncontrolled, necessitating a hysterectomy. Post-hysterectomy, the patient was discharged after 3 days and initially reported doing well. However, the bleeding recurred, leading to a cuff repair. Subsequent bleeding episodes required hypogastric artery ligation. Despite these interventions, the patient continued to experience bleeding and was referred to our clinic.

**Initial Examination at Our Clinic:**
- Hemodynamics: Stable
- Lab Parameters: Normal
- Ultrasonography: Normal ovaries, no fluid in the abdominal cavity
- Vaginal Examination: No bleeding

**Clinical Course:**
On the third day of admission to our clinic, the patient experienced heavy bleeding. Her hemoglobin level was critically low at 4.8 g/dL. An emergency surgery was performed, but no active bleeding focus was detected. A consultation with a radiologist led to a CT with contrast enhancement, revealing findings suggestive of an aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area. The patient underwent angiography in the interventional radiology clinic, where an arteriovenous fistula was closed, and the right internal iliac artery was obstructed. Despite these measures, the patient continued to experience intermittent bleeding after the partial intraoperative ligation.

**Assessment and Plan:**
The patient presents with persistent intermittent bleeding post-hysterectomy and multiple surgical interventions. The recent angiographic intervention has not completely resolved the bleeding. Further evaluation and management strategies need to be considered to address the ongoing bleeding and stabilize the patient's condition.
