**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain and diarrhea for the past three months.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports experiencing abdominal pain and diarrhea for the past three months. The symptoms began one month after being discharged from a previous hospitalization following a road traffic accident. During that hospitalization, the patient was admitted to another surgical department, and an abdominal ultrasound showed no intraperitoneal fluid or solid organ injury. However, there was a progressive decrease in hematocrit value during the first 48 hours, and an abdominal CT scan revealed a small amount of fluid in the rectovesical pouch, no solid organ abnormalities, and a large hematoma in the subcutaneous fat tissue on both lumbar areas. The patient was hemodynamically stable and received a transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells and three units of fresh frozen plasma. The patient improved rapidly with conservative treatment and was discharged on the fifth day, asymptomatic at that time.

One month post-discharge, the patient began experiencing episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea after meals, leading to a 10 kg weight loss due to reduced food intake out of fear of diarrhea. The patient now presents with colicky pain in the periumbilical region for the last 24 hours and has had two episodes of vomiting.

**Physical Examination:**
- Abdomen: Mildly distended with diffuse tenderness in the hypogastrium. No rebound or guarding. No palpable abdominal masses.
- Bowel sounds: Increased.

**Laboratory and Imaging:**
- Blood tests: Unremarkable.
- Plain abdominal X-rays: Revealed a dilated small bowel loop consistent with intestinal obstruction.
- Enhanced-abdominal CT scan: Showed a small bowel loop with a thickened wall and narrow lumen, proximal bowel dilation, and increased density.

**Treatment and Plan:**
The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluid replacement and a nasogastric tube, but symptoms did not resolve. Based on the findings, the patient will be admitted for further observation and treatment. Close monitoring and additional tests will be scheduled to assess the condition further.
