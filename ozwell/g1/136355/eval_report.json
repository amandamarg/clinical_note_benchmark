Both describe the medical history and surgical treatment of a 55-year-old female patient with a ventral hernia and a history of multiple abdominal surgeries due to tuberculosis. They detail the patient's admission with 40% acute flame burns, the history of a burst abdomen and temporary colostomy, and the development of a large ventral hernia. Both notes outline the surgical plan involving a TFL graft from the left thigh and an islanded TFL myocutaneous flap from the right thigh to repair the abdominal defect. They describe the surgical procedure, including the dimensions of the defects and grafts, and the postoperative course, which was uneventful. The notes conclude with an assessment that the patient is recovering well with no complications."}}
