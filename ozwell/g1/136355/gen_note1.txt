**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** 40% acute flame burns on neck, chest, anterior abdominal wall, and upper limbs.  
- **Medical History:**  
  - Multiple abdominal surgeries 10 years ago due to tuberculosis.  
  - Exploratory laparotomy with burst abdomen and temporary colostomy.  
  - Development of a large ventral hernia.  
  - Open mesh repair 5 years ago, which got infected and was removed.  

**Current Condition:**  
- Presented with a ventral hernia with second-degree deep dermal burns on the skin over the hernia, which was grafted.  
- Type 2 abdominal wall defect.  

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Deferred the option of microvascular free flap.  
- Planned a TFL graft harvested from the left thigh for closing the rectus defect and an islanded TFL myocutaneous flap from the right thigh for the abdominal defect.  

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Incised the edge of the hernia and excised the skin adherent to the peritoneum.  
- Identified a 20 cm x 12 cm defect in the lower two-thirds of the midline of the abdomen.  
- Harvested a fascia lata graft from the left thigh measuring 18 cm x 10 cm and sutured it to the edge of the abdominal wall.  
- Elevated the TFL islanded flap on the right side, measuring 30 cm x 10 cm, and rotated it 120Â° to reach the upper limit of the abdominal defect.  
- Incised the segment between the proximal end of the flap and the lower end of the abdominal defect in the right iliac region, opening it up to the external fascia to accommodate the bridging segment of the flap.  
- Reinforced the fascia to the inside wall edge and sutured the skin with a closed suction drain.  

**Postoperative Period:**  
- Uneventful.  
- Closed suction drain was removed.  

**Follow-up:**  
- Patient has no questions or concerns at this time.  
- Advised to return if any issues arise.
