They both describe the case of a 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman admitted to the hospital due to a fetal cardiac mass. Both notes detail the diagnostic findings, including the fetal echocardiography results showing a heterogeneous lesion on the right side of the heart, compression of the tricuspid annulus, and pericardial effusion. They also describe the procedures performed, including the EXIT procedure, cesarean section, and the drainage of pericardial effusion. Additionally, both notes mention the neonate's condition post-delivery, the administration of dopamine, and the cardiac tumor resection under cardiopulmonary bypass. The outcome for both the mother and the neonate is also consistent across the notes, with the mother recovering uneventfully and the neonate being discharged after a month."}}
