**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Gestational Age:** More than 30 weeks

**Reason for Admission:**
- Fetal cardiac mass

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- Fetal echocardiography showed a heterogeneous lesion on the right side of the heart, measuring 2.85 cm Ã— 2.25 cm.
- The lesion compressed the tricuspid annulus by 50%.
- Presence of pericardial effusion.
- Difficulty in distinguishing the source of the fetal cardiac mass, either within the heart or in the pericardial cavity.
- Fetal heart rate decreased to less than 80 bpm, and pericardial effusion continued to increase during hospitalization.

**Procedure:**
- EXIT procedure performed due to fetal risk.
- Cesarean section conducted.
- Fetus released from the uterus with placental circulation kept intact.
- Mass located within the right atrium.
- Approximately 30 ml of pericardial effusion drained.
- Neonate intubated with mechanical respiratory support.
- Heart function impaired by cardiac mass compression.
- Neonate received dopamine.
- Cardiac tumor resected under cardiopulmonary bypass.

**Outcome:**
- Patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on the 5th day postoperatively.
