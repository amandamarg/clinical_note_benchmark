They both describe the medical case of a 56-year-old man named John who presented with shortness of breath and sudden chest pain. Both notes detail the findings of various tests, including normal coronary arteries, pulmonary emboli, a large mass in the right kidney, and a thrombus in the right renal vein extending into the inferior vena cava. They also describe the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli and renal cell carcinoma with tumor emboli, the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and the surgical interventions performed, including right radical nephrectomy, resection of the tumor in the abdominal IVC, and pulmonary embolectomy. The outcome and follow-up details are also consistent between the two notes."}}
