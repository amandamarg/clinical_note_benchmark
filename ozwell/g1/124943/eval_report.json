Both describe the medical history and current condition of a 50-year-old woman with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, who has had a VA shunt replaced with a VP shunt. They both detail the migration of the VA shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery, causing severe pulmonic insufficiency. The notes mention the echocardiogram findings, stress echocardiogram results, and previous tests like the pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging test and coronary angiography. Both notes discuss the assessment and plan, including the decision against endovascular removal due to risk and the recommendation for open surgical intracardiac catheter removal and repair. The follow-up actions are also similar, focusing on surgical scheduling and symptom management."}}
