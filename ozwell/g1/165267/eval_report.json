They both describe the case of a 53-year-old woman with a palpable mass at the left medial canthal region, a history of tearing and occasional bloody discharge, and a diagnosis of malignant melanoma after a dacryocystectomy. Both notes include details about the patient's medical history, physical examination, imaging results, the surgical procedure, pathology findings, and follow-up plans. The main difference is that the first note includes more detailed narrative information, while the second note is structured as a clinical note with specific sections for each aspect of the case."}}
