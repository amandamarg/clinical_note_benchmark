Both describe the same patient case involving a 40-year-old female with severe pain and burning sensation in the right buccal mucosa due to an accidental injection of formalin instead of a local anesthetic. They both detail the patient's history of tobacco chewing, the presence of a leukoplakia patch, and the subsequent medical interventions and management, including the administration of dexamethasone, pain management, and antibiotics. The notes also mention the patient's discharge against medical advice, follow-up visits, and the eventual excision of necrotic tissue and reconstruction with a collagen membrane. The clinical note provides a concise summary of the case, while the context information offers a more detailed narrative."}}
