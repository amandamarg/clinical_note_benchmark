Both notes mention the patient's history, the discovery of the hernia, the surgical procedure performed, and the postoperative instructions. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note. The first note provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's history and surgical procedure, while the second note is a clinical summary with structured sections like Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Surgical Procedure, Postoperative Instructions, and Follow-Up."}}
