**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right lower quadrant pain and mass.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain and an intermittent bulge, which began approximately two weeks ago after performing pull-ups at the gym. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 10 mm hernia in the right lower quadrant containing some fat and a possible tubular structure, which was suspected to be the appendix. The decision was made to proceed with a laparoscopic incisional hernia repair.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy in December 2010 with a 12 mm trocar placed in the right lower quadrant.
- Developed widely metastatic disease over the subsequent 18 months.
- Presented to the clinic in May 2012 with a symptomatic right lower quadrant trocar site hernia.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
Elective hernia repair was performed. Pneumoperitoneum was established through a 12 mm umbilical Hasson port, with two additional 5 mm ports placed in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic area. Inspection of the abdomen showed no evidence of peritoneal disease. A small hernia containing an incarcerated appendix was identified in the right lower quadrant, consistent with preoperative imaging findings.

**Postoperative Instructions:**  
The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next few weeks to allow for proper healing. The patient was instructed to contact the clinic if any pain or discomfort arises.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient understands the postoperative care instructions and will follow up as needed.
