**Subjective:**  
The patient presented for a follow-up after undergoing surgery for a bilateral cleft lip and severe nose deformity. The patient reported that the bridge of the nose was short and flat prior to surgery. The surgery involved improving nasal morphology using cartilage from the nasal septum and addressing the lip deformity by forming a tubercle of the upper lip using a lip switch flap.

**Objective:**  
Post-surgery, the flap's color was initially favorable, but marked swelling and venous congestion developed 6 hours later. The sutures around the pedicle were removed to release pressure, but circulation did not improve, and congestion worsened. The flap was predicted to undergo necrosis, so it was returned to the lower lip 8 hours post-surgery to improve blood circulation and prevent necrosis. Under venous sedation, the flap was released to a free state, oropharyngeal intubation was applied, and sedation was switched to general anesthesia. The hematoma around the flap was removed with saline washing. After confirming blood flow from the flap stump, the flap was returned to the lower lip and fixed with sutures, and the transplantation site was simply sutured. The flap was covered with heparinized saline-soaked gauze to reduce congestion. Congestion improved 7 hours later, and the flap returned to the donor site had almost completely recovered 1 week post-surgery. The flap was re-transplanted with sufficient tissue around the pedicle under local anesthesia, and the engraftment was favorable, with transection occurring after 9 days.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is doing well 2 years post-surgery, with the cleft appearing satisfactory.

**Plan:**  
No further immediate interventions are necessary. The patient is advised to return if any concerns arise.
