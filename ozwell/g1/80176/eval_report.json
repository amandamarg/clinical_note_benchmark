Both notes mention the patient's dissatisfaction with the functional limitations of the elbow arthrodesis, the development of a hypertrophic nonunion, and the decision to combine the repair of the nonunion with the conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty. They also describe the surgical procedure, including the use of a Stryker distal humeral replacement system and the patient's postoperative progress. The main difference is in the level of detail and structure, with the clinical note being more concise and focused on the subjective, objective, assessment, and plan (SOAP) format."}}
