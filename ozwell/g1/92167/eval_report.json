Both describe the medical history and treatment of a 64-year-old Caucasian man from Austria who experienced episodes of intermittent gross hematuria. They detail his past treatment for colorectal carcinoma, the development of ureteric strictures, and the placement of ureteric stents. Both notes mention the diagnostic procedures performed, such as retrograde pyelography, cystoscopy, CT scans, ureteroscopy, and arteriography, which initially failed to identify the source of bleeding. They also describe the patient's hemodynamic instability, the nephrectomy performed on the right side, and the eventual identification and treatment of a fistula at the distal common iliac artery with a stent graft. The notes conclude with the patient's recovery and the loss of the right kidney. The main difference is the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other a narrative description."}}
