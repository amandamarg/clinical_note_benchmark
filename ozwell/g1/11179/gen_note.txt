**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:28:46 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe pain and headache, right leg pale and numb.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with severe pain and headache, along with a pale and numb right leg. Symptoms began approximately two hours ago while the patient was working on the farm and have been progressively worsening.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Absent pulse in the right leg.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- **Doppler Ultrasound:** Revealed a thrombus in the right common iliac artery, causing pain and absent pulses.
- **Echocardiogram:** Identified a cystic mass in the left ventricle with a thrombus inside, indicating a fluid-filled sac causing the collapse of the left ventricle.
- **Chest X-ray:** Confirmed the presence of a hydatid cyst, which has ruptured.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is in a state of hemodynamic instability, with symptoms including chest pain, anuria, and elevated renal indices, indicating impaired kidney function. The situation is serious and requires urgent surgical intervention.

**Plan:**  
1. Inform the patient's relatives about the risk and urgency of the situation.
2. Proceed with an emergency embolectomy to remove the embolus, which are fragments of the infected cyst.
3. Perform an open fasciotomy due to signs of compartment syndrome in the legs.
4. Conduct open-heart surgery to remove the ruptured cardiac hydatid cyst. Prior to surgery, inject hypertonic saline into the heart to minimize or prevent the spread of fluid and parasites.

The patient has been informed of the situation and consents to the proposed surgical interventions. Surgery will commence as soon as possible.
