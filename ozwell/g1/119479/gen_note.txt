**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Inability to open mouth wide for dental treatment.  
- **Medical History:** Diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy at age one via muscle biopsy. Never walked and unable to move arms or legs. Bedridden since age eight due to aspiration pneumonia. Uses continuous positive airway pressure during sleep.  
- **Neck Condition:** Neck usually turned to the left due to difficulty breathing and dyspnea when turned to the right.  
- **Surgical History:** Underwent general anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in 2008 and 2010. History of tracheostomy for dyspnea post-general anesthesia in the ICU after the second surgery.  
- **Oral Condition:** Able to open mouth voluntarily and eat regular food. Complains of pain in TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, hindering treatment for long-term molar pain.  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The patient was referred for dental treatment under general anesthesia for molar area treatment. However, due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on medical history and physical examination, general anesthesia was deferred.  
- Local anesthesia was performed on the TMJ area to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment.  
- 1 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia at the dental clinic before oral and maxillofacial surgery.  
- The patient reported no pain while opening the mouth approximately 10 minutes post-injection.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- The patient's condition will continue to be monitored, and follow-up will be conducted after the procedure.
