Both notes mention the two incidents of sudden cardiac death after physical activity, the initial and follow-up ECG findings, the surgical intervention, and the subsequent diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). They also both discuss the treatment with a \u03b2-blocker and the recommendation to avoid heavy exercise. However, the clinical note provides a more structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information is more detailed and narrative in style."}}
