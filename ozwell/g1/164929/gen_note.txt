**Time:** 7:43:47 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports being referred to the department for heart problems. The patient has a history of two incidents of sudden cardiac death after physical activity. The first incident occurred after heavy exercise, and the second incident occurred after boxing.

**Objective:**  
- **First Incident:**  
  - Emergency room resuscitation after basic life support.  
  - Treated with hypothermic treatment and fully recovered.  
  - Initial ECG showed pulseless electrical activity.  
  - Echocardiography showed no structural heart disease and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.  
  - Cardiac computed tomography revealed anomalous origin of the RCA.  
  - Follow-up ECGs showed a sinus rhythm with an inverted T wave and a prolonged QT interval.  
  - Laboratory findings showed no electrolyte abnormalities.  

- **Surgery:**  
  - Successful re-implantation of the anomalous RCA.  
  - Patient was doing well before the second incident.  

- **Second Incident:**  
  - Coronary angiogram with a provocation test using ergonovine showed no significant abnormalities, and the re-implantation site of the RCA ostium was intact.  
  - Electrophysiologic study showed no other arrhythmias.  

**Assessment:**  
Based on the information provided, the anomalous origin of the RCA was likely the cause of the aborted cardiac arrest.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor heart function.  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks.  
- Advise the patient to contact the office if any symptoms occur or if there are any concerns to discuss.
