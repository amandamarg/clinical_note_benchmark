**Time:** 7:34:37 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing significant pain in the right shoulder and chest wall following a weight lifting injury. The injury occurred during a one-rep max bench press when the patient felt a pop in the right upper arm, followed by severe pain. The patient denies any history of anabolic steroid use. Initial treatment included ice and a sling, followed by evaluation in the emergency department where plain films were negative for fracture or dislocation. The patient was discharged home in a sling and presented to the orthopedic clinic the following day with moderate pain in the chest and arm. The patient denies experiencing any numbness or paresthesia in the arm.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed a large amount of swelling and ecchymoses throughout the right upper arm extending into the pectoralis major muscle belly, and a large bulge in the anterior chest with loss of contour of the axillary fold. The patient has full active range of motion of the elbow, wrist, and digits, and is sensory intact throughout the right upper extremity with a 2+ radial pulse. An MRI was performed, demonstrating avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction, as well as strain of the anterior deltoid.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was scheduled for surgery in five days and prescribed oxycodone and valium to alleviate pain and muscle spasms until surgery. However, the patient returned two days later with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm at the midpoint of the biceps at the point of maximal swelling were 37, 39, and 42 mmHg, with a diastolic blood pressure of 71 mmHg, confirming the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.

**Plan:**  
With the diagnosis of compartment syndrome confirmed, the patient was taken to the operating room for an emergency fasciotomy. Further management and follow-up will be determined based on the patient's recovery and response to the procedure.
