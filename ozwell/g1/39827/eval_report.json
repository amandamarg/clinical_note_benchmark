Both notes describe the case of a 33-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted due to decreased fetal movements and fetal malformation detected during a routine ultrasound. They both mention the presence of uterine myomas, the findings from the ultrasound, the diagnosis of arthrogryposis secondary to fetal akinesia due to a giant leiomyoma, and the decision for elective termination of pregnancy. The details of the delivery, the condition of the fetus at birth, and the pathology report are also consistent between the two notes."}}
