**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. [Patient's Last Name]

**Date:** [Today's Date]

**Subjective:**
The patient was admitted to our department following a routine ultrasound at 16 weeks of pregnancy, which showed decreased fetal movements and fetal deformity. The patient reports a family history that is unremarkable and a medical history that is nonsignificant except for the presence of two intramural uterine myomas diagnosed before this pregnancy. These myomas were smaller than 47 mm in maximum diameter in previous control one year before gestation.

**Objective:**
Ultrasound investigation verified the presence of an intramural-submucosal tumor with a muscular echogenic pattern and a size of 110 × 88 mm in the anterior uterine wall near the internal cervical os, and another intramural one with a size of 28 × 21 mm in the uterine fundus. The fetus presented a normal heart rate pattern but was observed to be absent movements and displaced to the right uterine wall in an abnormal position with hyperextension of the head and strongly flexed lower limbs. Fetal measures according to the gestational age and the amount of amniotic fluid were normal.

**Assessment:**
The diagnosis of arthrogryposis secondary to fetal akinesia due to giant leiomyoma was made. According to the Spanish legislation, the patient and her partner decided on the elective termination of pregnancy.

**Plan:**
A vaginal delivery was induced with local prostaglandins without complications. At the time of birth, the fetus had no cardiac activity and showed external male genitals, a weight of 105 g, and a length of 125 mm. His position consisted of internal rotation of the shoulders and stiffness of the limbs with symmetrically flexed and fixed elbows and wrists and severe equinovarus deformities of the feet. The pathology report concluded that internal organs of the fetus did not present abnormalities. Histopathological examination reported extraconnective tissue developed around the joints and tissue between the muscle fibers swollen with the presence of red blood cells. Chromosomal analysis was normal, and the study of fetal DNA excluded spinal muscular atrophy as there were no deletions.

**Follow-up:**
The patient was informed of the findings and the outcome. She was encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns. Further follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed.
