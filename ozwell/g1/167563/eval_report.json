Both describe a 25-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent pain and swelling on his right cheek for three months. They mention his past surgical history of bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, during which a dislodged orthodontic appliance was identified in his right cheek. The notes detail the examination findings, including a sinus with pus discharge and tenderness in the upper right vestibular region. Both notes suspect that the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance and outline a plan for further tests and potential removal of the appliance. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the surgical exploration and removal of the appliance, while the second note focuses on the clinical assessment and plan for further action."}}
