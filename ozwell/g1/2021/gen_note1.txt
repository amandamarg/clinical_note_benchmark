**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:49:03 AM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand.  

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension for 4 years.  
- No history of trauma.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Presence of palpable pulsatile masses in both axillae.  
- Mass size: 12 cm in the right axilla, 8 cm in the left axilla.  

**Ultrasound Examination:**  
- Right axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 12-cm segment, measuring 67 × 45 mm with a 27-mm thick thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen.  
- Left axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 9-cm segment, measuring 40 × 43 mm with a 17-mm thick thrombus.  

**Doppler Ultrasonic Examination:**  
- Thrombus surrounding the lumen with turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center.  
- Aneurysmal segment continuous with the brachial artery.  

**CT Angiography:**  
- Giant fusiform aneurysms detected: 140 × 77 mm in the right axillary artery, 93 × 45 mm in the left axillary artery.  
- Thrombi present in both aneurysms, allowing flow in the lumen.  
- Extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm, likely due to a spontaneously healed rupture.  

**Additional Findings:**  
- No signs of collagen tissue disease detected in the eyes, bones, skin, and joints through physical or laboratory examinations.  

**Plan:**  
- Due to the patient's symptoms and high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate size stents could not be found for aneurysms so large and tortuous.  
- Instructed the patient on follow-up requirements.  
- Patient to return in a week for a check-up.
