They both describe the medical case of a 72-year-old male patient with bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. Both notes detail the patient's medical history of hypertension, the findings from physical, ultrasound, Doppler ultrasonic, and CT angiography examinations, and the plan for treatment. The notes also mention the lack of signs of collagen tissue disease and the decision to refer the patient for surgery due to the large size and high mobility of the aneurysms. The main difference is the format and some minor details, but the content and clinical information are consistent across both notes."}}
