**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 20 years old
- Gender: Not specified

**Chief Complaint:**
- Painful swelling on the left thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports a sharp pain in the left thigh that worsens with movement. The pain began after being kicked by a friend.

**Initial Evaluation:**
- Plain radiography revealed a concentric cystic lesion with cortical thinning and ballooning in the mid-portion of the femoral shaft, accompanied by a pathologic fracture.

**Initial Treatment:**
- The patient underwent curettage of the cystic bone lesion and autogenous bone grafting, followed by open reduction and internal fixation for the pathologic fracture.
- Biopsy during the operation revealed a unicameral bone cyst.
- Post-operative management included close observation without further intervention.

**Follow-Up:**
- Two years post-surgery, the plate was removed based on radiographic evidence of complete healing of the cystic bone lesion.
- Initial leg length discrepancy of 1.5 cm was noted, which increased with age.
- Annual follow-up was scheduled until skeletal maturity.
- At age 19, no recurrence of the cyst was seen on femur radiographs.
- Final leg length discrepancy was 3.5 cm, leading to complaints of abnormal gait and posture. Lengthening of the shortened femur was planned.

**Current Presentation:**
- At age 20, the patient reports recurrence of pain in the left thigh, similar to previous episodes.

**Recent Evaluation:**
- Plain radiography and MRI scan were performed.
- MRI showed a 6.6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm-sized, well-defined cystic lesion in the left distal femur.
- Radiographs and MRI findings indicated a linear pathologic fracture with a periosteal reaction.

**Recent Treatment:**
- Curettage and autogenous bone grafting were performed, combined with internal fixation using an intramedullary nail.
- One year post-second surgery, the lesion was stabilized despite cortical thinning and ballooning of the femur.

**Plan:**
- Continue close monitoring with regular follow-up appointments to assess the stability of the lesion and address any further complications.
