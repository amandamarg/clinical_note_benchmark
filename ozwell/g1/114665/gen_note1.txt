**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Age:** 20  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Painful swelling on the left thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a painful swelling on the left thigh, which started after being kicked by a friend. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with leg movement. Initial plain radiography revealed a concentric cystic lesion with cortical thinning and ballooning in the mid-portion of the femoral shaft, accompanied by a pathologic fracture. The patient underwent curettage of the cystic bone lesion and autogenous bone grafting, followed by open reduction and internal fixation for the pathologic fracture. A biopsy confirmed a unicameral bone cyst. 

**Past Surgical History:**  
- Curettage and autogenous bone grafting with internal fixation for pathologic fracture.
- Plate removal two years post-surgery after radiographic evidence of complete healing.
- Noted 1.5 cm femoral shortening post-surgery, which increased to a 3.5 cm leg length discrepancy by age 19, causing abnormal gait and posture. Lengthening of the shortened femur was planned.

**Current Visit:**  
At age 20, the patient reports recurrence of pain in the left thigh. Plain radiography and MRI scan revealed a 6.6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm-sized, well-defined cystic lesion in the left distal femur, with a linear pathologic fracture and periosteal reaction. Treatment included curettage and autogenous bone grafting combined with internal fixation using an intramedullary nail. One year post-second surgery, the lesion is stabilized despite cortical thinning and ballooning of the femur.

**Plan:**  
Continue close observation with regular follow-up appointments to monitor the lesion and overall condition of the femur. Address leg length discrepancy and associated gait abnormalities as planned.

**Follow-Up:**  
Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the condition.
