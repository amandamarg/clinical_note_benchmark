Both notes mention the initial presentation of painful swelling after being kicked, the discovery of a cystic lesion with a pathologic fracture, and the subsequent surgical interventions including curettage, bone grafting, and internal fixation. They also discuss the leg length discrepancy that developed over time and the planned femur lengthening. Additionally, both notes detail the recurrence of the cyst at age 20, the treatment with an intramedullary nail, and the ongoing follow-up to monitor the condition. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, focusing on the chief complaint, history of present illness, assessment, and plan, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey."}}
