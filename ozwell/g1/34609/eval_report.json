Both describe the same patient's medical history, recent events, hospital course, and management plan. They both mention the patient's road traffic accident 18 months ago, the resulting severe head injury and pelvic fracture, and the occasional episodes of anterior chest pain and dyspnea on moderate exertion. They also detail the recent admission due to severe chest pain and shortness of breath, the findings of a large aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta, and the subsequent endoluminal thoracic aortic stenting procedure. Post-procedure complications, such as the collapse of the left lung and the conservative management plan, are also consistently described in both notes."}}
