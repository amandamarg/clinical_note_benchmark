Both notes mention the patient's previous nephrectomy, the treatment received post-surgery, and the recent presentation of abdominal pain. They also describe the findings from the CT scan and the resection of the pelvic mass, including the intraoperative consultation and the histological findings. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed histological and immunohistochemical findings, while the second note is a more concise summary of the patient's history and recent clinical events."}}
