**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 1:38:30 AM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient presented with a history of pain and deformity in both arms, which has been ongoing for a long time. The patient reported having synthol injections in the biceps four years ago, with a total of 16 injections in each bicep administered four times a week for four weeks. Post-injection, the patient experienced pain and pressure, initially rated at 4/10, which gradually increased to 6/10. Despite the pain, the patient continued training sessions until the pain became severe, rated at 7/10, leading to cessation of training after two years. The pain was described as constant and persistent, becoming intolerable over time.

**Physical Examination:**  
The examination revealed rubbery firm hypertrophic and dysmorphic biceps in both arms with a free range of motion. The patient reported constant painful pressure within the right muscle more than the left, along with muscle deformity and several tender points throughout the biceps muscle.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, revealing a swollen right biceps muscle with cystic lesions scattered throughout the muscle tissue, exhibiting a hyperintense signal. These lesions were identified as oil deposits between muscle fibers, known as oleomas. The muscle showed fibrotic changes in appearance, and contrast enhancement was inhomogeneous, indicating inflammation.

**Treatment:**  
Due to ongoing pain and lack of therapeutic alternatives, an open surgical excision of the anterior third of the biceps was performed through an anterior bicipital approach.

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
The findings revealed no common muscle tissue remaining, but rather massive fibrotic tissue.

**Outcome:**  
The surgical excision was successful. The patient was advised to take good care of themselves and follow aftercare instructions strictly.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was instructed to contact the physician with any questions or concerns.
