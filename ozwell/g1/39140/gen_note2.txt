**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and deformity in both arms.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports having pain and deformity in both arms for a long time. Four years ago, the patient received synthol injections in the biceps, with a total of 16 injections in each bicep, administered four times a week for four weeks. Initially, the pain was rated 4 out of 10, but it gradually increased to 6 out of 10. Despite the pain, the patient continued training sessions. After two years, the pain became severe, rated 7 out of 10, leading the patient to stop training due to its constant and persistent nature.

**Physical Examination:**  
The patient was observed to have rubbery firm hypertrophic and dysmorphic biceps in both arms with a free range of motion. The patient complained of constant painful pressure within the right muscle more than the left one, muscle deformity, and several tender points all over the biceps muscle.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a swollen right biceps muscle and cystic lesions scattered throughout the muscle tissue with a hyperintense signal. These lesions were identified as oil deposits between muscle fibers, known as oleomas. The muscle underwent fibrotic changes in its appearance, and contrast enhancement was inhomogeneous, indicating the presence of inflammation.

**Treatment:**  
Due to ongoing pain and lack of therapeutic alternatives, an open surgical excision of the anterior third of the biceps was performed through an anterior bicipital approach.

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
The findings showed no common muscle tissue left but massive fibrotic tissue.

**Outcome:**  
The surgical excision was successful.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to take good care of themselves and follow the aftercare instructions strictly. The patient is encouraged to contact the physician if there are any questions or concerns.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored for recovery and any potential complications. Further follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed.
