Both describe the case of a 29-year-old Middle Eastern male bodybuilder who experienced pain and deformity in his biceps due to prior synthol injections. They detail the history of the injections, the progression of pain, the physical examination findings, the MRI results, the surgical treatment, and the postoperative outcome. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific wording used, but the core information and sequence of events are consistent across both notes."}}
