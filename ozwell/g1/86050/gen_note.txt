The patient presented with obstructed labor after being in labor for one day and experiencing leaking fluid for 48 hours. She became aware of her pregnancy after feeling quickening at four months of gestation.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient is experiencing obstructed labor with signs of fetal distress. Due to the patient's severe kyphosis and physical condition, a C-section delivery is necessary for the safety of both the mother and the baby. The procedure was explained to the patient, and she consented to the surgery. The patient will be prepped for surgery and will need to stay in the hospital for a few days post-delivery for monitoring.
