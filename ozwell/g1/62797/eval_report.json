Both describe the case of a 32-year-old female who experienced a severe left knee injury during a dance aerobics class, leading to a lateral patellar dislocation with an avulsion fracture. They detail the unsuccessful attempts at closed reduction in the emergency room, the eventual surgical intervention, and the findings during the procedure. Both notes mention the incarceration of the patella in the lateral patellar retinaculum, the subsequent reduction, and the diagnostic arthroscopy findings. The follow-up plan involving physical therapy and monitoring is also consistent in both notes."}}
