They both describe the medical history and recent surgical procedure of a 55-year-old male patient with type 2 diabetes and a non-healing ulcer on the right leg. Both notes detail the patient's previous surgical history, the failed attempt at implant removal, and the new technique used to remove the remaining screws. The notes also mention the use of stainless steel metal cutting blades and the decision to leave the threaded parts of the screws in the bone. The plan for monitoring the patient's progress and scheduling a follow-up appointment is also included in both notes."}}
