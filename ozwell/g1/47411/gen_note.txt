**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mr. X  
**Physician:** Dr. Y  
**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Chief Complaint:**  
Recurrent papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with associated symptoms.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. X is a patient with a history of papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, initially treated with radical cystectomy and ureterostomy seven years ago. The malignancy recurred five years post-operation. The patient currently presents with a mass on the right side of the pelvis, compressing the right external iliac vein, and bilateral diffuse lung metastasis. He has undergone 12 courses of chemotherapy.

**Current Symptoms:**  
- Severe swelling in the right lower extremity, larger in diameter than the left limb.
- Right lower extremity pain.
- Venous ulcer at the right medial malleolus.

**Procedures and Findings:**  
A venography was performed in the prone position to assess the underlying cause of venous stasis in the right lower extremity. A 5F sheath was introduced through the right popliteal vein under local anesthesia and close monitoring of vital signs. The patient was then repositioned to a supine position for cannulation of the right superficial femoral vein using ultrasound guidance and the Seldinger technique, 10 cm below the inguinal ligament. This position change was necessary to perform the stenting procedure under deep sedation, which was not feasible in the prone position due to the patient's general condition.

A repeat venogram in the supine position showed similar results. Additional venography at 45 and 90 degrees of left lateral oblique views confirmed severe stenosis and tumor invasion. A 0.035 hydrophilic standard guidewire was used to cross the stenosis, followed by the introduction of a 40 mm length and 10 mm diameter CONQUEST balloon.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The pelvic mass resection is not indicated due to diffuse lung metastasis.
- Continue monitoring and managing symptoms.
- Patient advised to reach out with any questions or concerns in the future.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was advised to contact the clinic if any further questions or concerns arise.
