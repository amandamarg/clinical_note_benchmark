They both mention the history of papillary urothelial carcinoma, the recurrence of malignancy, the presence of a pelvic mass compressing the right external iliac vein, and bilateral diffuse lung metastasis. Both notes detail the severe swelling and pain in the right lower extremity, the venous ulcer, and the venography procedure performed to assess venous stasis. They also describe the stenting procedure, the medications administered, and the follow-up plan. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note, with the clinical note providing a more structured overview and the procedural note offering a detailed account of the venography and stenting process."}}
