Both mention the patient's history of bilateral total knee replacement (TKR) in 2012 due to severe osteoarthritis (OA) and the subsequent inability to walk, leading to wheelchair dependence. They also highlight the patient's long-standing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with atypical presentation and the recommendation for bilateral hip replacement surgery, which the patient is reluctant to undergo due to financial constraints and a previous negative surgical experience. Both notes suggest exploring alternative treatment options and continuing pain management. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the patient's treatment history and progress with integrated physiotherapy, while the second note is a clinical summary with an assessment and plan for further action."}}
