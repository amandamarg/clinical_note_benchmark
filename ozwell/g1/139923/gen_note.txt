**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain in both hip joints for the past three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in both hip joints for the past three months, which has rendered them unable to walk, stand, climb, or perform any activities involving the lower limbs. The patient has a history of bilateral total knee replacement (TKR) in July 2012 due to severe osteoarthritis (OA) of both knees. Post-operatively, the patient was unable to walk and has been wheelchair-bound since. The patient was advised by the previous surgeon to undergo bilateral hip replacement to regain mobility but expressed unwillingness due to a previous bad experience and financial constraints. The patient was advised to continue taking painkillers until they could arrange for the surgery. The patient sought alternative treatment options but was informed that nothing else could be done.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Bilateral TKR in July 2012 for severe OA of both knees.
- Long-standing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 2009, with atypical presentation starting as knee pain and later involving hands, feet, shoulder, hip, and wrist. Hip presentation was atypical for RA.

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**  
- RA test: 26 u/ml (normal up to 15 u/ml).
- Other blood parameters and X-rays did not support the diagnosis of RA.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient is experiencing significant pain and mobility issues due to hip joint problems. Bilateral hip replacement surgery is recommended to alleviate pain and improve mobility. However, due to the patient's financial concerns and previous negative surgical experience, a referral to a specialist for potential alternative treatment options is advised.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and discussion of alternative treatment options. Continue current pain management regimen as advised.
