**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for the past month.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy six months ago at another medical college due to three days of abdominal pain. A small peptic perforation was detected and repaired with an omental patch. On the fourth post-operative day, the patient developed a burst abdomen, which was managed conservatively. The bowel eventually recovered, and the patient was put on oral nutrition and discharged. However, the abdominal wound did not heal properly.

- In the fourth month post-surgery, the wound was covered with a split thickness skin graft. The procedure and post-operative period were uneventful. In the fifth month, a serous discharge was noticed from a small ulcer on the upper part of the grafted surface. The discharge was small in amount, and the patient managed it by applying gauge pieces over the wound, changing them once or sometimes two to three times a day.

**Physical Examination:**
- Examination of the abdomen revealed a 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft over the middle of the abdomen. A small depressed ulcer of approximately 1 cm × 1 cm was present in the upper part, covered with pale granulation and showing serous ooze. There were a few other spots with exuberant pale granulation. The patient reported discomfort in the area.

- Palpation revealed a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**
- Blood reports were mostly normal:
  - Hemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl
  - Total WBC count: 11.6 × 10^3/mm^3
  - Total serum protein: 7.9 gm/dl
  - Serum albumin: 3.5 gm/dl

- Ultrasound showed a left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm.

**Assessment and Plan:**
- There is a suspicion of some missed pathology from the previous surgery. Further tests, including a CT scan, are recommended to better assess the area and determine the best course of action. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled, and consultation with a specialist in wound care may be necessary.

**Patient Instructions:**
- The patient was advised to schedule a follow-up appointment and to contact the clinic with any further concerns. The patient's family will be kept informed of the progress if necessary.
