They both detail the patient's initial surgery for a peptic perforation, the subsequent complications including a burst abdomen and non-healing wound, the development of a gastrocutaneous fistula, and the eventual repeat surgery to address these issues. Both notes include information about the patient's physical examination, laboratory and imaging results, and the assessment and plan for further treatment. The main difference is in the level of detail and the way the information is structured, but the core content is essentially the same."}}
