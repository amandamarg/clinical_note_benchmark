**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient admitted for induction of labor at 37 2/7 weeks due to abnormal antenatal testing.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has a history of a prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm and opted for a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). Upon admission, the initial cervical exam showed 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement. Labor was induced with oxytocin, and amniotomy was performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted. The patient progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over 10 hours and from 5 cm to 6 cm over 3.5 hours. During labor, the patient experienced a moderate amount of vaginal bleeding. Fetal heart rate monitoring showed minimal variability and variable decelerations, which did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
Due to concerns about uterine rupture or placental abruption, the patient was taken to the operating room for a repeat cesarean delivery. Upon entering the abdomen, no evidence of uterine rupture, dehiscence, or significant placental abruption was found. The patient delivered a healthy male infant weighing 2659 g with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The arterial cord pH was 7.26.

Following the repair of the hysterotomy, a distended and edematous bladder was noted despite a patent Foley catheter. A vaginal exam was performed to evaluate the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder due to concern for an occult uterine rupture or dehiscence. The exam revealed a spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock. The avulsed portion of the cervix appeared necrotic, with no bleeding at the site of detachment. An attempt to repair the site vaginally resulted in the complete detachment of the cervix, with no excessive bleeding noted.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the patient's recovery closely for any further complications.
- Discuss future pregnancies and delivery options with the patient.
- Advise the patient to report any abnormal symptoms immediately.
- Keep the patient's family informed of her progress.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely during her recovery, and further discussions regarding future pregnancies will be scheduled.
