**Patient History:**

The patient presented with a history of pain, redness, and swelling in the right thumb, initially experienced in May 2009. The symptoms worsened over the course of one week, with no previous history of similar events or trauma to the thumb. The patient underwent an incision and drainage procedure for a diagnosed paronychia, with cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient received IV antibiotics and was discharged in stable condition with resolution of symptoms.

Four months later, the patient presented with pain along the radial aspect of the thumb and a small amount of granulomatous tissue. Conservative follow-up led to cessation of drainage, but the patient continued to experience occasional pain in the radial aspect of the nail fold and interphalangeal joint. A nail deformity was observed, prompting a biopsy. The biopsy specimen revealed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and pyogenic granuloma.

Subsequently, the patient underwent re-excision of the nail bed, nail fold, and bone in the biopsy area with local flap reconstruction. The resection margins were 5 mm from the biopsy incision. Final pathology indicated two focal areas of squamous cell carcinoma in the bony segment. An amputation at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb was performed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy, which was negative for malignancy. The 7500 Real Time PCR system was employed for evaluation.

**Plan:**

The patient is advised to continue monitoring their health and to return for evaluation if any changes are noticed.
