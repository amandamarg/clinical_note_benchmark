Both describe the medical history and treatment of a 68-year-old female patient who initially presented with symptoms in her right thumb in May 2009. They detail the diagnosis of paronychia, the incision and drainage procedure, and the subsequent discovery of squamous cell carcinoma and pyogenic granuloma. Both notes mention the re-excision of the nail bed, nail fold, and bone, the amputation at the interphalangeal joint, and the negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. They also describe the use of the 7500 Real Time PCR system to evaluate for HPV, with a positive reaction for at least one HPV isotype. The main difference is the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and sequence of events are consistent."}}
