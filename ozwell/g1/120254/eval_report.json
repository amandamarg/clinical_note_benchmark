Both describe the case of a 51-year-old male who underwent DSAEK with IOL implantation in his left eye and later presented with issues such as redness and defective vision. They detail the patient's postoperative medication regimen, initial examination findings, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute graft rejection. Both notes also describe the treatment plan involving topical and systemic steroids, the subsequent deterioration in both eyes, and the eventual diagnosis of microsporidial infection through in vivo confocal microscopy. The treatment was adjusted to include topical fluconazole and oral acetazolamide, leading to improvement in the patient's condition. The notes cover the same sequence of events and medical findings, with slight variations in wording and detail."}}
