**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:13:28 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Issues with left eye post-IOL implantation, including redness and defective vision.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient underwent IOL implantation in the left eye 7 weeks ago. Postoperatively, the patient has been using topical prednisolone acetate 1% and gatifloxacin 0.3% eye drops, each three times a day. Two weeks ago, the eye was quiet with a clear graft and normal intraocular pressure. The right eye had an IOL implantation in 2012 and has been doing well.

**Examination Findings:**  
- **Visual Acuity:** Right eye: 20/40, Left eye: 20/200.  
- **Slit Lamp Examination (Left Eye):** Moderate bulbar and tarsal conjunctival injection with papillae, a few randomly distributed coarse superficial punctate lesions, graft edema with overlying stromal edema, and no keratic precipitates. Mild anterior chamber reaction noted.  
- **Diagnosis:** Presumptive diagnosis of acute graft rejection in the left eye.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The patient has been admitted and started on hourly topical prednisolone acetate 1% and systemic steroids injection dexamethasone 2 cc intramuscularly once a day.

**Follow-Up Examination:**  
- **Left Eye:** Increase in corneal edema to the host stroma, involving the peripheral cornea. Moderate anterior chamber reaction, no keratic precipitates. Visual acuity remains at status quo.  
- **Right Eye:** Complained of defective vision, visual acuity found to be 20/80. Mild conjunctival injection, diffuse edema of the entire cornea, and a few coarse superficial punctate lesions similar to those seen in the left eye at presentation.  
- **Left Eye (Current):** Large epithelial defect approximately 6 mm Ã— 4 mm in diameter with persistent graft and stromal edema. Typical coarse superficial punctate lesions at presentation.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the condition and adjust treatment as needed. The patient is advised to follow all instructions and attend follow-up appointments.
