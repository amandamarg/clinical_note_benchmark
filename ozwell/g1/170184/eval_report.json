Both notes mention the patient's referral for orthodontic evaluation, the medical history of mild pulmonary valve stenosis and secundum atrial septal defect, and the family history of maxillofacial anomalies. They also describe the clinical examination findings, the radiological examination showing suspicious hypomineralisations, and the surgical intervention performed under general anesthesia. Additionally, both notes discuss the histopathological findings and the referral to the Bone Tumor Reference Center for further diagnosis. The main difference is that the clinical note is more structured with sections like Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan, while the context information provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey over time."}}
