**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Location:** Medical Center of the University of GÃ¶ttingen  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They were referred by their family dentist for a routine orthodontic control and evaluation of treatment need. The patient has a medical history of mild pulmonary valve stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect with a left-right shunt. The family history is positive for maxillofacial anomalies, with the patient's older sister previously diagnosed with a dysplastic fibroma. The patient's father and paternal grandmother have a history of odontogenic cysts and basal cell carcinomas, although the family history of OKCs is negative.

**Objective:**  
- Clinical examination revealed no extra or intraoral pathological findings.  
- Physical and cardiac fitness are good, with normal nutritional status.  
- Radiological examination showed suspicious hypomineralisations visible as radiolucencies in the panoramic radiograph associated with retained teeth 13 and 23 and ectopic tooth 27.  
- The patient was referred to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery for surgical examination of the radiologic anomalies.  
- Surgery was performed under general anesthesia with no complications. During the radical cystectomy, tooth 27 was removed due to massive attachment loss.  
- Histopathological biopsy showed a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23, and the biopsy from region 27 showed an odontogenic connective tissue cyst wall with intramural odontogenic cell islands.  
- Samples were sent for further diagnosis to the Bone Tumor Reference Center of the Swiss Society of Pathology.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a fibroosseous lesion in the area of teeth 13 and 23, with no visible intraoperative pathological signs in the suspected pathological area. The biopsy from region 27 confirmed an odontogenic connective tissue cyst wall with intramural odontogenic cell islands.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to follow up with their healthcare provider for further instructions and treatment options. Further diagnostic evaluation and management will be guided by the results from the Bone Tumor Reference Center.  

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family was informed of the findings and the importance of follow-up care. They expressed concern upon hearing the news.
