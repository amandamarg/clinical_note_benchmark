**Patient Encounter Summary:**

The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and presented with a right femur fracture, contusions, and a splenic injury that necessitated a splenectomy. A traction pin was placed in the right femur to stabilize the fracture, with a weight of 25 pounds applied. The procedure was performed without difficulty using sterile technique.

Post-operatively, the patient's condition deteriorated over the next three days, exhibiting fevers, increasing leukocytosis, and cardiopulmonary instability. The patient required intubation during hospitalization. Significant swelling and erythema were noted in the right thigh and hip region, prompting a radiograph and CT scan to evaluate for abscess or hematoma formation. The scan revealed mild serous drainage around the traction pin sites, with no purulence observed. However, significant edema and erythema were present, particularly around the knee and slightly more than the proximal thigh.

Due to the findings of a significant amount of soft tissue gas in the thigh, the patient was taken to the operating room for evaluation and debridement. During the incision, malodorous gas was released, and it was discovered that all distal muscle and fascia were necrotic. Consequently, a proximal open guillotine transfemoral amputation through the fracture site was performed, along with debridement of the lower abdominal wall.

Deep tissue specimens identified Clostridium perfringens as the causative organism. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed to the condition.

**Outcome:**  
The patient passed away. My condolences to the family. If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
