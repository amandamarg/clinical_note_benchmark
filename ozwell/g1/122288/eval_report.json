Both describe the same medical case involving an 88-year-old man who was transferred for vascular surgery after an attempted pacemaker placement resulted in a descending thoracic aortic injury. They detail the patient's initial condition, the discovery of the arterial injury, the decision to use a stent graft due to the patient's comorbidities and age, and the successful outcome of the procedure. Both notes mention the use of a pigtail catheter, the cerebral angiogram findings, and the successful sealing of the injury site. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note, with the first note providing a more detailed procedural account and the second note summarizing the history and outcome."}}
