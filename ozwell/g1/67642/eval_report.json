Both notes mention her diagnosis of CKD as a teenager, the discovery of small kidneys, unexplained anemia, and the development of gout. They also discuss her family history, including her mother's and maternal grandmother's kidney issues. The diagnosis of Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD) is mentioned in both notes. However, the first note provides more detailed genetic testing information and the outcome of a kidney transplant, while the second note is a clinical summary for a kidney donor evaluation."}}
