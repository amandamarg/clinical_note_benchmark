They both describe the same medical procedure involving a 10-year-old girl with leukemia who required a central venous (CV) line placement for chemotherapy. Both notes detail the process of obtaining consent, the use of standard monitoring, the selection of the right internal jugular vein for cannulation, the use of propofol for sedation, and the insertion of a single-lumen 14-gauge catheter. They also describe the complications encountered with the catheter's position, the use of ultrasonography for verification, and the eventual successful placement of a new catheter. The conclusion and plan for monitoring the patient's condition are also consistent in both notes."}}
