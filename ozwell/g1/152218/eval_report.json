They both describe the same patient, Jane, with a history of epilepsy who experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Both notes mention the seizure lasting 5 minutes, the resulting head injury, and the patient's difficulty breathing, leading to intubation. They also describe her unconscious state upon arrival at the hospital, her low blood pressure, and the lack of verbal or pain responses. Both notes detail her past medical history, including epilepsy, moderate mental retardation, and non-compliance with treatment. The hospital course is also similar, noting the initiation of antiepileptic treatment, the observation of flaccid quadriplegia, and the findings from the cervical MRI. The assessment and plan sections emphasize the need for continued monitoring, antiepileptic treatment, and addressing the spinal cord injury."}}
