Both describe the medical history and findings related to a 40-year-old Asian woman who was found to have a small nodule in her right lung and a lytic lesion in her lumbar vertebra during a regular checkup. They both mention the initial suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, the follow-up five years later showing an increase in size of the lesions, and the surgical interventions performed. Both notes also highlight the postoperative progress, indicating that the patient remained free of disease 41 months after the operation. The conclusion in both notes emphasizes the patient's good recovery and the plan for continued monitoring."}}
