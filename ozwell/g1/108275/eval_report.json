Both notes detail the patient's initial presentation with pain and swelling in the left knee, the findings from physical examination, and the diagnostic results indicating a giant cell tumor. They also describe the progression of the condition, the surgical management plan involving wide excision and endoprosthesis, and the patient's understanding and agreement to the treatment plan. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more structured format with specific headings, while the other note is more narrative in style."}}
