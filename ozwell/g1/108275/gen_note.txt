**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:29:20 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Pain and swelling in the left knee for the past 8 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling in the left knee for the past 8 months, with an increase in swelling size over the past 2 months. The swelling is described as diffuse, located over the lateral aspect of the distal thigh, measuring approximately 12 cm in length and 5 cm across. The pain is constant and exacerbated by knee movement.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Gross wasting of the quadriceps muscle noted.  
- Raised temperature and tenderness on deep palpation, restricting terminal knee flexion.  

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Sclerotic lesion identified in the left distal end femur.  
- Biopsy results indicate cellular tissues with multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells.  
- Histological diagnosis: Giant cell tumor.  

**Follow-up Findings:**  
The patient was lost to follow-up and returned with an enlarged mass measuring 15 cm x 12 cm, with ulceration over the lateral aspect of the knee. Radiograph findings include a large destructive lesion in the distal femur with chondroid matrix, broad zone of transition with break-in cortex, and destruction of joint margin.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Diagnosis: Giant cell tumor of the left distal femur with significant progression.  
- Management: Plan to excise the tumor with a wide excision and reconstruct the limb using an endoprosthesis to provide functional ability.  
- Surgical Considerations: Careful dissection to protect the neurovascular bundle and prevent soft-tissue spillage.  
- Postoperative Plan: Confirm safety post-surgery and initiate recovery process.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
The patient understands the diagnosis and the proposed surgical management plan, including the risks and benefits, and agrees to proceed with the treatment.
