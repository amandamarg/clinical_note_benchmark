Both describe the case of a 66-year-old man who has been on hemodialysis for several years and is currently using a catheter in the left femoral vein. They both mention his history of lung empyema and the failure of multiple AVFs in both upper extremities. The notes detail the decision to create a new AVF in the upper extremity due to the increased risk of infection with AVG, and they describe the ultrasound mapping and findings regarding the basilic and brachial veins. The surgical plan and procedure, including the transposition of the left medial brachial vein and the use of skip incisions, are also outlined in both notes. Finally, both notes mention the follow-up plan and the absence of complications post-surgery."}}
