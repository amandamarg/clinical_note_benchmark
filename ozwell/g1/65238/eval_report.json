Both notes detail the diagnostic workup, including a chest X-ray, CT scan, core needle biopsy, and incisional biopsy, leading to a final diagnosis of an aneurysmal bone cyst. They also describe the treatment plan involving a total sternectomy and the surgical procedure, including the use of a cryopreserved sternal allograft for repair. Postoperative findings and follow-up recommendations are also consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of figures and the exact wording used."}}
