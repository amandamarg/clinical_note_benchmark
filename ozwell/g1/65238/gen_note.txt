**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Referred to:** Thoracic Surgery Unit  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Deformity and bulging in the anterior part of the chest wall in the sternal area with mild pain.

**History and Examination:**  
The patient presented with a deformity and bulging in the anterior chest wall, specifically in the sternal area, accompanied by mild pain. Initial investigations included a chest X-ray and a CT scan. The CT scan revealed a large mass with the possibility of a primary sternal tumor or an anterior mediastinal tumor with invasion to the sternum.

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
A core needle biopsy was performed, and the pathologic diagnosis was compatible with a giant cell tumor. Following the pathologist's recommendation, an incisional biopsy was conducted, leading to a final pathologic diagnosis of an aneurysmal bone cyst.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The best treatment option was determined to be resection of the lesion. Due to the size of the tumor, a total sternectomy was planned.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
A midline incision was made, revealing no infiltration or adhesion of the mass to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. A well-defined, capsulated but highly vascular mass was dissected from surrounding tissues. The pectoralis major muscles were pushed laterally. Hemostasis was challenging on the left side, and all attachments of the sternum and ribs were severed. Minimal adhesion of the tumor to the right upper lobe was lysed easily, while dense adhesion to the anterior part of the pericardium was managed by partial resection and repair with PTFE mesh. Total sternectomy was achieved by disarticulating the bilateral sternoclavicular joints.

**Postoperative Findings:**  
The large 20 Ã— 20 cm mass was completely resected, leaving an extensive defect in the chest wall. A cryopreserved sternal allograft was considered for repair. The allograft was harvested from a suitable cadaver in our center and cryopreserved in another tissue bank about one month prior to the operation.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to have regular follow-up check-ups to ensure proper recovery and monitor for any complications.
