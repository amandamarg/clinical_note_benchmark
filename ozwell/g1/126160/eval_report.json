Both describe the case of a 28-year-old primigravida referred for further evaluation due to abnormal fetal echocardiography findings. They detail the findings from various examinations, including ultrasound and fetal MRI, which indicated significant thoracic and lung abnormalities. Both notes also describe the delivery details, the unsuccessful resuscitation attempts, and the outcome of the neonate's death. The main difference is the format and some specific details, but the core information and sequence of events are consistent across both notes."}}
