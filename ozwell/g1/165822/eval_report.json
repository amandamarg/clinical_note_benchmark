Both notes mention her history of thrombosis, anticoagulation therapy, and the development of end-stage renal disease due to diabetes and hypertension. They also detail the preoperative preparation, intraoperative management, and postoperative care, including the use of heparin and the patient's stable condition post-surgery. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the first note being more narrative and detailed, while the second note is structured in a clinical note format with sections for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan."}}
