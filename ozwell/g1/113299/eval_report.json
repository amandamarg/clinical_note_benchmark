Both describe the case of an 18-year-old female patient with missing teeth, uncoordinated mandibular movements due to a neurological disorder, and a high arched palate. They both detail the challenges of making dental impressions due to the patient's restricted mouth opening and high arched palate. The solution in both notes involves using a customized balloon impression tray, with modifications to a stock tray and the use of a latex balloon attached to a flat acrylic palatal plate. The process of inflating the balloon with a sphygmomanometer bulb to capture the impression is also described in both notes. The main difference is the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of a clinical note in the second note."}}
