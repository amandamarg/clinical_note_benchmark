Both notes detail the patient's vital signs, examination findings, and the results of investigations such as the chest X-ray and CT scan. They both diagnose a contained ruptured aortic rupture, multiple rib fractures, and left pleural effusion. The management plan in both notes involves an urgent open surgical technique due to the severity of the aortic injury, with details of the surgical procedure provided. However, the outcomes differ: the first note indicates the patient responded well and is on regular follow-up, while the second note states the patient did not survive the surgery."}}
