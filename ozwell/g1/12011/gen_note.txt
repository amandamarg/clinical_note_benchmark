**Presenting Complaint:** Severe chest and back pain following a motor vehicle accident.  

**History:**  
The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident and presented with severe chest and back pain. The patient was unable to provide pulse rate and blood pressure initially.  

**Examination:**  
- **Vital Signs:**  
  - Pulse rate: 134 per minute  
  - Blood pressure: 86/64 mm/Hg  
  - Extremities: Cold and clammy  

- **Auscultation:**  
  - Heart sounds: Audible without any adventitious sounds  
  - Breath sounds: Diminished in the left lower chest  

**Investigations:**  
- **Chest X-ray:** Revealed multiple rib fractures with mediastinal widening and left pleural effusion.  
- **CT Scan:** Showed a contained ruptured aortic rupture immediately below the level of the isthmus.  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Contained ruptured aortic rupture involving more than 50% of its circumference at the site of injury.  
- Multiple rib fractures.  
- Left pleural effusion.  

**Management Plan:**  
- Due to the severity of the aortic injury, endovascular stenting was not possible. An urgent open surgical technique was advised.  
- The patient was taken to the operation theater and intubated with a single lung tube. Positioned in a right lateral position, a left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  
- A huge contained hematoma was found during surgery.  
- Surgery was conducted on left heart bypass on normothermia.  
  - A 16Fr aortic cannula was inserted into the left superior pulmonary vein as an outflow circuit.  
  - An 18Fr aortic cannula was inserted into the descending thoracic aorta just above the level of the diaphragm as an inflow circuit.  
  - The circuit was connected to the heart and lung machine, and bypass was initiated at a flow rate of 1500 mL/min.  
  - A cross clamp was applied 2 cm below the origin of the left subclavian artery.  

**Outcome:**  
Despite best efforts, the patient did not survive the surgery due to the severity of the injury.
