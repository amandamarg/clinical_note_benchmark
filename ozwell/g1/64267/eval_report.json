Both notes detail the symptoms, diagnostic imaging findings, diagnosis, and the surgical plan involving three-dimensional navigation-guided surgery with the use of a customized interocclusal splint. They also mention the procedure preparation and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the clinical note is a concise summary, while the detailed description provides more in-depth information about the surgical procedure and technical aspects."}}
