Both notes detail the patient's initial presentation, the findings from imaging studies (CTA and DSA), and the treatment plan involving dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin. They also mention the severe stenosis in the left vertebral artery, the occlusion in the right vertebral artery, and the presence of an unstable clot at the vertebrobasilar junction. The notes describe the patient's transfer to a Comprehensive Stroke Center for specialized care and the subsequent resolution of the clot, leading to a successful stenting procedure and full clinical recovery. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific focus of each note, with the clinical note providing a more concise summary of the patient's condition and treatment plan."}}
