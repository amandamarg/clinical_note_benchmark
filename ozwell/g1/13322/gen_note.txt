**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:13:46 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Family Present:** Yes  

**Subjective:**  
The patient, [Patient's Name], is deceased, and the family is present for a discussion regarding the findings from a routine dissection. The family inquired about the cause of death and the findings during the dissection.

**Objective:**  
- **Cause of Death:** Myocardial infarction (heart attack).
- **Dissection Findings:** 
  - A variant mesenteric artery was identified between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA).
  - The variant artery originated from the abdominal aorta and ran obliquely superiorly toward the left colic flexure.
  - The variant artery gave rise to two branches with free anastomosis within the mesocolon of the transverse and descending colon.
  - The celiac artery and SMA originated independently from the ventral surface of the abdominal aorta about 1 cm apart.
  - The celiac artery had a normal branching pattern.
  - Branches from the SMA included the inferior pancreaticoduodenal, right colic, ileocolic, jejunal, and ileal arteries.
  - The middle colic artery, typically arising from the SMA, was missing.
  - The IMA originated from the ventrolateral surface of the distal abdominal aorta about 6 cm from the origin of the SMA, giving rise to the sigmoid arteries and superior rectal artery.
  - The left colic artery, usually originating from the IMA, was missing.
  - The variant artery was about 2 cm proximal to the origin of the IMA.
  - The first branch of the variant artery ran transversally to the left to supply the proximal part of the descending colon.
  - The second branch ascended upward between the layers of the transverse mesocolon, giving rise to two branches that supplied the distal part of the ascending colon and the transverse colon.

**Assessment:**  
The findings of the variant mesenteric artery are unusual but do not have clinical significance for the patient or the family, as they were discovered post-mortem during a routine dissection.

**Plan:**  
- Inform the family that the findings have no implications for them.
- Provide education on myocardial infarction as requested by the family.
- Offer to answer any further questions the family may have.
