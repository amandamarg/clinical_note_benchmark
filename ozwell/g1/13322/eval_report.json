Both notes mention the discovery of a variant mesenteric artery originating from the abdominal aorta between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). They detail the branching patterns of the celiac artery, SMA, and IMA, and note the absence of the middle colic artery and left colic artery. The clinical note adds context by mentioning the presence of the family, the cause of death (myocardial infarction), and the plan to inform the family about the findings and provide education on myocardial infarction."}}
