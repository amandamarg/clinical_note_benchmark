**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 36 years
- Premenopausal

**Chief Complaint:**
- Painful mass in the left breast, growing rapidly over the past two months.

**Family History:**
- No family history of breast cancer.

**Physical Examination:**
- Mass is well circumscribed, elastic, approximately 30 mm.
- Not attached to underlying tissues or skin.
- No skin or nipple retraction.
- No ipsilateral, axillary, or supraclavicular palpable lymph nodes.
- No nipple discharge.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Breast Ultrasound:** Cyst measuring 26 mm with irregular and hypoechogenic vegetation on the inner wall.
- **Mammography:** Not performed due to cystic appearance of the mass; no characteristic findings specific for this type of tumor.
- **Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC):** Yellowish, translucent fluid obtained; mass size reduced post-procedure. Smears stained with Papanicolaou and May-Grünwald Giemsa stains. Microscopic evaluation showed foam cells and epithelial cells without atypia, suggesting a benign cystic lesion.

**Follow-Up:**
- One month later, breast ultrasound showed persistence of the cyst with increased volume (44 mm) and inner vegetation (6 × 27 mm), irregular in shape and continuous with the cyst wall.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Due to rapid growth and ultrasound characteristics, surgery was performed.
- At hospitalization, physical examination revealed a painful large mass (90 mm) in the outer quadrants of the left breast.
- Breast tumorectomy was performed.

**Plan:**
- Follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor progress.
