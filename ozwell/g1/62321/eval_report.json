They both describe the case of a 36-year-old premenopausal woman with a rapidly growing painful mass in the left breast. Both notes detail the absence of significant medical history or family history of breast cancer, the findings from physical examination, and the results of diagnostic tests such as breast ultrasound and FNAC. They also describe the surgical intervention and follow-up plan. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the histological examination and treatment plan, including the diagnosis of pure squamous cell carcinoma, the immunostaining results, and the adjuvant therapy received. The second note is more concise and focuses on the initial presentation, diagnostic tests, and surgical intervention."}}
