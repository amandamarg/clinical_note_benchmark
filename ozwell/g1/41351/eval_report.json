Both describe the same patient's medical history, the issue with the Staphylococcus aureus infection of the endocardial pacing system, and the subsequent surgical procedure for the implantation of a new epicardial pacing system. They both detail the patient's past medical history, the procedure performed, and the outcome. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the clinical note being more structured with sections like Subjective, Objective, Procedure, Assessment/Plan, and Follow-up."}}
