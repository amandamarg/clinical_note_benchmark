**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [Patient's MRN]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay, though a little bit tired. The patient presented with a Staphylococcus aureus infection of the endocardial pacing system. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Mild dilated cardiomyopathy  
- Ventricular tachycardia  
- Biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy  
- Several previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and left subclavian veins  

**Objective:**  
Due to subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection, a transvenous approach was not feasible. The patient was referred for surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system.

**Procedure:**  
- A lower half limited median sternotomy was performed starting from the xiphoid process up to the level of the third intercostal space.  
- A second limited transverse sternotomy was performed starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy.  
- The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure and easy access to both the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle.  
- Right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage.  
- Right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle.  
- Access to the left ventricle was achieved by gently lifting up the heart, using an epicardial tissue stabilizing system, and exposing the lateral wall of the left ventricle with no hemodynamic compromise.  
- The left ventricular lead was screwed into the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries.  
- The defibrillator patch was sutured to the distal lateral wall.  
- The pacing box was inserted in the sheath of the right rectus muscle, ensuring good orientation between the patch and the pacing box.  
- Thresholds on the pacing leads were checked, and the defibrillating patch was tested.  
- A right subcostal incision was made, and a pocket was created in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle.  
- Pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle into the pocket.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient has undergone successful surgical implantation of a new epicardial pacing system. The patient will be monitored for any complications and will follow up as scheduled. 

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return for a follow-up appointment as planned. 

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient did not express any questions or concerns at this time.
