Both describe the case of a 63-year-old gentleman who presented with non-specific periumbilical pain and nausea, and both detail the findings from the CT scan, the surgical procedure, and the pathology results. They both mention the initial suspicion of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, the surgical resection of the mass, and the final pathology revealing a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) arising from the omentum. Both notes also discuss the decision not to pursue adjuvant therapy and the patient's uneventful recovery and follow-up. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the first note being more narrative and detailed, while the second note is structured in a clinical note format with sections for Subjective, Objective, Assessment/Plan, and Follow-up."}}
