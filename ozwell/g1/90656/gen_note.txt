**Patient:** Mrs. [Patient's Last Name]

**Date:** [Today's Date]

**Subjective:**
The patient presented with pain in the right hip and thigh following a fall in her bathroom. She reported tenderness and pain upon movement of the right leg.

**Objective:**
Radiographs of the right femur revealed a transverse fracture of the right subtrochanteric region. Assessment of the trabecular pattern of the trochanteric region indicated Singh's grade one porosis with near absence of the trabeculae in the femoral head and neck. Dual X-ray absorptiometry showed a T score greater than 2.5 standard deviations below normal, indicating osteoporosis. 

**Assessment:**
The patient was diagnosed with a transverse fracture of the right subtrochanteric region and underlying senile osteoporosis. Due to the extremely thin cortices of the femur, schanz pin assisted reduction was deemed potentially damaging, and dynamic hip screw fixation was precluded due to the risk of cut out.

**Plan:**
The patient was placed on traction and advised to undergo surgery for early ambulation. The fracture was reduced on a traction table after opening the area, and fixation was achieved with a dynamic condylar screw (DCS) and a 95-degree barrel plate. The plate was affixed with four cancellous screws on either side of the fracture due to the tenuous nature of the cortices. Post-operatively, the patient underwent supervised physiotherapy over a period of six weeks. At ten weeks, the fracture had united, and the patient was allowed full weight bearing. Treatment with bisphosphonates was initiated for the underlying osteoporosis.

**Follow-Up:**
At the last follow-up, three years post-operative, the patient was pain-free with a full range of motion of the hip joint. Radiographs showed improved cortex thickness. The patient was advised to continue physiotherapy and bisphosphonate treatment as prescribed. A follow-up appointment is to be scheduled in a few months.
