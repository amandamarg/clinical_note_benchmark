Both describe the case of a 60-year-old female patient who presented with sudden onset left-sided weakness and dysphasia, with an initial NIHSS score of 20. They both mention the treatment with thrombolysis and endovascular mechanical clot removal, resulting in an improvement to an NIHSS score of 2 within 24 hours. Both notes discuss the findings of multiple infarcts with hemorrhages, the suspicion of infective endocarditis, the discovery of a mobile mass on the mitral valve, and the subsequent investigations revealing a large pelvic mass suggestive of an ovarian tumor. The notes also cover the patient's poor clinical response to antibiotics, the sterile blood cultures, and the imaging findings of embolic events. Overall, the content and sequence of events in both notes are consistent with each other."}}
