**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Weakness on the left side and trouble speaking.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with sudden onset of left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking, which began a few days ago. The patient denies any history of stroke and does not have known risk factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

**Initial Assessment:**  
Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient's National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 20, indicating a severe stroke. A brain CT did not show any established infarct, but a CT cranial angiogram revealed a thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery.

**Treatment and Progress:**  
The patient was treated with thrombolysis and endovascular mechanical clot removal, resulting in an improvement to an NIHSS score of 2 within 24 hours. A brain MRI showed multiple infarcts with hemorrhages in the right middle cerebral artery territory and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, suggesting a possible embolic source.

**Additional Findings:**  
The patient's history revealed a four-week period of feeling unwell, with symptoms including low-grade fever, raised inflammatory markers, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, raising the suspicion of infective endocarditis. An urgent echocardiogram showed a mobile mass on the anterior mitral valve leaflet, confirmed as a vegetation on transoesophageal echocardiography, measuring 11 × 4 mm and prolapsing into the left ventricular outflow tract with mild aortic regurgitation.

**Further Investigations:**  
Despite treatment for infective endocarditis with intravenous antibiotics, the patient continued to experience intermittent fever and persistent raised inflammatory markers, with sterile blood cultures and serology. Further studies, including virology, vasculitic screen, and serology for atypical organisms, were negative.

A CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large pelvic mass suggestive of a right-sided ovarian tumor measuring 9 × 9 cm, with no evidence of metastasis. Imaging also showed pulmonary, splenic, and renal embolic events with evidence of infarcts.

**Conclusion:**  
Despite therapy, the patient experienced multi-systemic embolization with a poor clinical response. Further management and evaluation are necessary to address the underlying conditions and complications.
