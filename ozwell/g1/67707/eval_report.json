Both notes mention the initial conservative treatment, subsequent surgeries including arthroscopies, MACI procedure, and the patient's current difficulties with weight-bearing activities and occupation. However, the clinical note provides a more structured format with sections for subjective, objective, assessment, plan, and follow-up, while the context information is more detailed and includes specific procedural and outcome details related to MSC therapy."}}
