**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Visit Type:** Follow-up

**Subjective:**

The patient reports experiencing numbness and mild pain in the left hand, which has been present since approximately 4 days after the creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for hemodialysis access. The symptoms are noted to increase at night. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetic nephropathy and has undergone the creation of a left basilic vein to left brachial artery AVF, with a plan for a second stage superficialization and transposition 6 weeks later. The patient also has a history of Charcot's disease of the left lower extremity, resulting in a below-knee amputation on the left side, and uses a wheelchair for ambulation. The patient has a history of tobacco use, with a 30 pack-year smoking history.

**Objective:**

- Physical examination revealed good grip strength in the left arm, a radial artery pulse of at least 2, and a good thrill in the venous segment of the fistula.
- During a follow-up visit 4 weeks post-surgery, the patient's hand was pink and warm with a good radial pulse.
- A duplex doppler ultrasound showed good flow in the fistula with no significant reversal of flow and no decreased blood flow in the lower part of the left arm.
- An electromyogram was ordered to evaluate for neurological etiologies.
- On subsequent follow-up, muscle wasting was noted in the left medial palm and dorsum.
- Sensation was decreased along the medial aspect of the left arm from the elbow, including part of the third, fourth, and fifth digits.
- Fasciculations were observed in the fingers of the left hand, and strength was reduced.
- The electromyogram reported moderate to severe generalized sensorimotor axonal neuropathy.

**Assessment:**

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of neurological complications following the creation of an AVF for hemodialysis access. The electromyogram findings indicate moderate to severe generalized sensorimotor axonal neuropathy.

**Plan:**

- The patient is advised to follow up with a specialist for further evaluation and management of the neuropathy.
- Continue monitoring the AVF and symptoms in the left hand.
- Consider potential interventions based on specialist recommendations.

**Follow-up:**

The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the specialist to address the neuropathy and any further concerns related to the AVF.
