Both notes mention the creation of a left basilic vein to left brachial artery arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and the subsequent development of numbness and mild pain in the left hand. They also describe the patient's history of Charcot's disease, below-knee amputation, and tobacco use. The objective findings, such as good grip strength, radial artery pulse, and good thrill in the venous segment of the fistula, are consistent in both notes. Additionally, both notes mention the electromyogram findings of moderate to severe generalized sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and the plan for further evaluation and management of the neuropathy. Overall, the notes provide a consistent account of the patient's medical condition and management plan."}}
