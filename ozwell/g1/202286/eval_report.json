Both notes cover the patient's injury during a bench press, the initial treatment, and the subsequent diagnosis of a pectoralis major tendon avulsion. They also mention the MRI findings, the scheduled surgery, and the emergency fasciotomy due to compartment syndrome. However, the first note provides a more detailed account of the surgical procedures and post-operative care, while the second note is more concise and focuses on the timeline of events and the patient's symptoms. Overall, they are similar in content but differ in the level of detail and emphasis."}}
