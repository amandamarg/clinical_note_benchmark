**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with hip pain and inability to bear weight following a mechanical fall at home. The patient has a past medical history of kidney disease and underwent a right total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.

**Objective:**  
- Examination revealed a shortened and externally rotated leg.
- Radiographs confirmed an extracapsular neck of femur fracture.
- Preoperative blood workup showed mild anaemia and chronic kidney disease stage 3.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The decision was made to perform internal fixation of the fracture using a dynamic hip screw, which was agreed upon by the patient and family.
- Surgery was performed by a registrar under image intensifier guidance, supervised by a consultant surgeon, with no intraoperative complications noted.
- Postoperatively, the patient developed persistent tachycardia and low oxygen saturations. A NM V/Q SPECT scan revealed a mismatch in the midzone of the left lung, consistent with a pulmonary embolism.
- Treatment dose enoxaparin was initiated for the pulmonary embolism.
- Over the following week, the patient experienced intermittent tachycardia and low blood pressure. Haemoglobin levels fell from 110 g/L to 80 g/L despite a 3 unit red blood cell transfusion. No external bleeding was observed, and the surgical wound remained clean and dry.
- Extensive proximal thigh bruising developed, suggesting possible bleeding from the fracture site.
- CT angiography and angiography demonstrated a large left thigh haematoma extending along the femoral sheath and a small area of active extravasation of contrast from a branch of the profunda femoris artery. A pseudoaneurysm was identified arising from a branch of the proximal profunda.
- The situation will be monitored closely, and the patient will be reviewed in a few days to assess progress.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be seen again in a few days for further evaluation and monitoring of the current condition.
