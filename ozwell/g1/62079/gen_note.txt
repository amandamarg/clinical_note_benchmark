**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:30 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Popping sensation in left hip and sharp pain in the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh after falling forward during a race.

**History:**  
- No history of other trauma or chronic disease.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- Swelling and tenderness at the posterolateral aspect of the left distal thigh.  
- No numbness or sensory loss reported.  
- Deficiency in the ridge formed by the left biceps femoris tendon upon visual inspection and palpation.  
- Inability to bear weight on the affected leg, preventing walking.

**Imaging:**  
- T2-weighted MRI of the left thigh showed loss of continuity of the distal biceps femoris tendon at the musculotendinous junction, surrounded by a hematoma with high signal intensity.

**Diagnosis:**  
- Isolated rupture of the distal part of the left biceps femoris tendon.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- Surgical exploration under lumbar spinal anaesthesia.  
- Lateral incision over the belly of the biceps femoris revealed complete rupture at the musculotendinous junction.  
- Tear repaired using a modified Kessler method with strong nonabsorbable sutures.  
- Postoperative immobilization of the knee in a plaster cast at 30Â° of flexion.

**Postoperative Complications:**  
- Numbness and sensory loss over the anterior aspect of the left foot.  
- Weak dorsiflexion of the foot diagnosed as common peroneal nerve palsy at the fibular head due to compression by the plaster cast.  
- Cast removed to decompress the nerve, but no neurological improvement observed.

**Follow-up:**  
- Surgical assessment 2 months post common peroneal palsy occurrence showed complete repair of the ruptured tendon, but persistent weakness in the common peroneal nerve.

**Instructions:**  
- Leg to remain immobilized and avoid weight-bearing for the next few weeks.  
- Follow-up appointment scheduled in 2 months.  
- Patient advised to report any numbness or sensory loss immediately.
