They both describe the case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced decreased visual acuity in her left eye following an autologous fat injection in the periocular area. Both notes detail the patient's symptoms, including loss of vision in the left eye, dysarthria, and a change in skin color of the nose. They also describe the physical examination findings, diagnostic tests, diagnosis, treatment administered, and follow-up observations. The information is consistent across both notes, with only minor differences in wording and structure."}}
