They both describe the case of an 82-year-old woman, Mrs. X, who was admitted to the hospital with right sciatic nerve palsy and a mass in the right posterior thigh. Both notes detail her history of sciatica, previous evaluations, and the findings from imaging studies. They also mention her past medical history of a partial gastrectomy for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, the surgical intervention performed, and the histological examination results. The plan for follow-up and further management is also consistent in both notes."}}
