They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 29-year-old woman with significant vaginal discharge, intermenstrual bleeding, and a cervical fibroid. Both notes mention her history of oral contraceptive use, normal STD screening results, and previous large loop excisions for intraepithelial neoplasia. They also detail her pregnancy, recurrent vaginal bleeding, and the management plan, including the decision against uterine artery embolization and the plan for a caesarean section. The notes include similar ultrasound findings and mention the patient's haemoglobin monitoring and treatment. Overall, the content and details in both notes are consistent with each other."}}
