**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]
- **Date:** 10/1/2025
- **Time:** 8:14:48 PM

**Chief Complaint:**
- Significant vaginal discharge for the past 8 months, requiring frequent changing of panty liners.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports experiencing significant vaginal discharge for the past 8 months. She also experienced several episodes of intermenstrual light vaginal bleeding. The patient was on oral contraceptive pills for 3 years, and the bleeding and discharge did not change after discontinuation of the pills. She was screened for sexually transmitted diseases by her general practitioner, and the results were normal. The patient has a history of two large loop excisions of the transformation zone for intraepithelial neoplasia.

**Clinical Examination and Investigations:**
- A 50 mm sessile cervical fibroid was found arising from the posterior wall of the left cervical lip of the cervix, confirmed by vaginal ultrasound scanning.

**Management and Treatment:**
- The patient was advised against uterine artery embolization due to the small risk of ovarian failure and risk of bleeding and infection, which could lead to a hysterectomy. She was advised to consider starting to try and conceive sooner rather than later. The patient became pregnant 8 weeks later, and a scan at 7 weeks confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy. She received regular antenatal care but experienced recurrent vaginal bleeding throughout the pregnancy due to cervical fibroids, leading to several admissions to the antenatal ward. Her haemoglobin was regularly monitored, and she was placed on prophylactic iron therapy. At 20 weeks gestation, her haemoglobin levels reached 8.4 gm/dL, and 2 units of blood were transfused. She was treated conservatively, and a plan for an elective caesarean section was agreed upon at 39 weeks gestation, with the understanding that it might be brought earlier if heavy bleeding developed before the agreed date.

**Ultrasound Findings:**
- At 20 weeks, the fibroid size increased to 81 × 78 × 88 mm.
- At 36 weeks, the fibroid size increased to 129 × 95 × 112 mm, larger than the size of the baby's head.

**Plan:**
- Discuss next steps and management options with the patient.
