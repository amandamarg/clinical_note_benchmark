Both describe the case of a 49-year-old female with a history of recurrent palpitations over the last 10 years, leading to multiple hospitalizations in the past year. They mention the use of intravenous adenosine and verapamil to terminate the palpitations, the absence of diabetes or hypertension, and normal physical examinations. Both notes detail the findings from the baseline ECG, the electrophysiological study, and the restudy, including the discovery of an absent right superior vena cava and the drainage into a dilated coronary sinus. They also discuss the risks associated with ablation and the plan for further management. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed procedural information, while the second note is a summarized clinical note."}}
