They both describe the medical history, clinical examination, investigations, follow-up, subsequent admission, surgical intervention, and procedure for a 38-year-old Vietnamese man with a history of epigastric pain, fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice. Both notes detail the findings of a CT scan, colonoscopy, and the surgical procedures performed, including a right hemicolectomy and the insertion of a duodenal stent. The main difference is that the second note includes a plan for the patient's follow-up and management."}}
