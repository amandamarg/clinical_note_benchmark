Both notes mention the patient's past treatments, including total thyroidectomy and postoperative iodine treatment, and the subsequent delayed metastases to the calcaneus and proximal tibia. They also describe the patient's current symptoms of recurrent left ankle pain, swelling, and edema, and the previous surgical interventions and treatments. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information is more narrative and detailed in describing the patient's medical history and treatment timeline."}}
