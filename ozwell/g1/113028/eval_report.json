Both describe the case of a 43-year-old incarcerated woman with borderline personality disorder who has a history of swallowing foreign objects during periods of stress. They detail her recent ingestion of a cup of bleach and an ink pen, her symptoms, and the medical evaluations and procedures she underwent. Both notes mention the CT findings, EGD results, and the eventual removal of the ink pen. The plan and follow-up advice are also consistent between the two notes, focusing on monitoring for complications, educating the patient, and advising her to return if issues arise."}}
