Both describe a 27-year-old female runner who participated in a study on muscle onset timing during prone leg extension and later suffered a right ankle sprain. They detail the injury, the absence of fractures, the exercise regimen advised, and the patient's recovery progress. Both notes mention the study's approval by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC and the patient's consent to publish results. The clinical note adds a plan for further testing and monitoring, while the case study provides more technical details about the study's methodology."}}
