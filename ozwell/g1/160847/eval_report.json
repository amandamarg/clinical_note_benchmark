Both describe the case of a 30-year-old female patient with pain and swelling above the right ankle joint and another swelling over the right iliac region. They both mention the patient's previous surgery for a lytic lesion in the distal tibia, the use of autologous bone grafts from the right iliac crest, and the histopathology revealing a benign giant cell tumor (GCT). Both notes detail the clinical findings, diagnostic imaging, and tests performed, as well as the assessment and plan for follow-up. The main difference is the format and some specific details like the inclusion of the physician's name and signature in the clinical note."}}
