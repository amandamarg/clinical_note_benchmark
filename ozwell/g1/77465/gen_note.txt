**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a dull ache and swelling on the right back, persisting for several weeks. The pain intensifies with movement. The patient is in good health and remains very active. A history of thoracic trauma at work one year ago was noted, with a diagnosis of a simple fracture of the 9th right rib.

**Objective:**  
Initial X-ray findings prompted a CT-scan of the thorax, revealing a tumor of the thoracic wall in the right hemithorax, measuring 8 Ã— 4 cm with heterogeneous density. The tumor involved and destructed the 9th rib, extending into two adjacent intercostal spaces. Importantly, the tumor did not involve the lung and muscular layers. The CT-scan also showed micronodular infiltrations in both lungs, with diameters up to 5 mm, and a single nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung, approximately 1 cm in diameter. The mediastinum was without enlarged lymph nodes, and no other lesions were observed in adjacent organs. The radiologist concluded a probable malignant tumor of the thoracic wall with secondary lesions in both lungs.

**Assessment:**  
Due to a lack of correlation between the clinical picture and radiological conclusion, a frozen biopsy of the right lung lesions and an excision biopsy of the thoracic wall tumor were performed. Samples from five nodular lesions in the right lung and the tumor were negative for malignant cells.

**Plan:**  
Given the biopsy results, an oncologic resection of the thoracic wall tumor was deemed appropriate. The procedure involved resecting three ribs, specifically the 8th and 9th ribs involved in the tumor. The patient is advised to follow up regularly to monitor recovery and ensure no further complications arise.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient agreed to regular follow-up appointments to monitor their condition post-surgery.
