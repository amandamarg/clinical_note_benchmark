Both notes mention the patient's history of deep vein thrombosis, the use of stents to treat stenosis, and the complications that arose from the stent migration. They also cover the patient's postoperative complications, including severe abdominal pain, open-heart surgery for stent retrieval, and subsequent management with anticoagulation therapy. The follow-up and recommendations are consistent in both notes, emphasizing the continuation of prescribed medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment. Overall, the notes are very similar, with the second note providing a more concise summary of the events and current status."}}
