Both describe the case of a 13-year-old boy who experienced left hip pain and inability to bear weight following a skiing accident. They both mention the diagnosis of an unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) and the initial surgery for percutaneous in-situ fixation. Both notes detail the recurrence of pain and hardware failure, leading to a second surgery for hardware removal and revision closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the SCFE. The surgical procedure and the patient's current status are also similarly described in both notes."}}
