**Time:** 7:27:42 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [MRN]  
**Age:** [Patient's Age]  
**Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Chief Complaint:** Recurrent swelling in the left lower extremity.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with recurrent swelling in the left lower extremity. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombus in the right distal lower extremity while on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the past. The patient denies current use of HRT or tobacco during this admission.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
A Venous Doppler ultrasound performed in the emergency room revealed extensive thrombosis in the left lower extremity. Further imaging indicated compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery, suggesting May-Thurner Syndrome. Intravenous ultrasound measurements were taken, and a stent was deployed at the area of stenosis to improve blood flow. However, the stent migrated, necessitating the use of a balloon to secure it.

**Complications:**  
The patient experienced severe abdominal pain due to further migration of the stent, which required open-heart surgery for retrieval.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The patient has been started on warfarin with heparin bridging postoperatively. Early ambulation and the use of elastic stockings are recommended to promote blood flow.

**Patient Concerns:**  
The patient expressed concern about the complications but had no additional concerns at the time of discharge.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will need close monitoring of anticoagulation therapy and follow-up appointments to assess recovery and prevent further complications.
