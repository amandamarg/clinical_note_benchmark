They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 30-year-old woman who was admitted for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. Both notes mention the previous identification of a giant ICA aneurysm during an evaluation for abducens nerve palsy, the endovascular trapping of the aneurysm, and the subsequent development of severe headache. They detail the patient's symptoms upon admission, including progressive dyspnea and dull headache, and the findings from MR imaging and cerebral angiography. The treatment plan involving a high-flow bypass and endovascular embolization is also described in both notes. The surgical details and follow-up plan are consistent across both notes."}}
