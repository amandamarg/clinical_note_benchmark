**Chief Complaint:**  
Mass on back with dull pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a mass on the back that has been present for approximately one year. The mass is located just below the right scapular line, near the ribs, and has recently been producing a dull pain. The patient reports that the size of the mass has not changed over the past year.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease  
- Hypercholesterolemia  
- Overweight  

**Surgical History:**  
No history of back trauma or surgery.

**Physical Examination:**  
Upon examination, the mass is located several centimeters below the initially indicated point. It measures approximately 5 cm in diameter, is soft, mobile, and has a smooth border. The mass is not reducible and does not appear to be painful upon palpation.

**Assessment:**  
Based on the physical findings and the high incidence of lipoma in individuals with similar complaints, the mass is suspected to be a lipoma.

**Plan:**  
Excision of the suspected lipoma is indicated due to the discomfort it is causing. The procedure will be approached minimally invasively. On the day of the surgery, a preoperative examination will be conducted. The patient will be positioned on the left side with legs flexed toward the chest to identify and mark the lumbar mass. Palpation of the lumbar mass is expected to reveal no tenderness, and the exam should be otherwise normal with no identified contraindications to surgery.

**Instructions:**  
The patient has been instructed to follow all preoperative instructions provided.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return on the day of the surgery for the procedure.
