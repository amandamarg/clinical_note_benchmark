**Patient History:**
The patient underwent a left nephrectomy in December 2008 due to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There is no family history of malignant neoplasm or chronic diseases.

**Treatment History:**
- The patient had metastatic disease with lung metastases and was initially treated with interferon immunotherapy. The best response achieved was partial regression. However, after 11 months, the disease progressed with enlargement of existing lesions, leading to the cessation of immunotherapy.
- In April 2010, the patient was qualified for 2nd line therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, receiving a total of 8 chemotherapy courses. The response to treatment was stable disease.
- Due to further disease progression, the patient was qualified for 3rd line therapy with the selective mTOR inhibitor, everolimus. The patient experienced marked toxicity, including grade 3 anemia according to CTC AE, requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells. After 13 courses, treatment was stopped due to disease progression and the appearance of new lesions in the lungs, left adrenal gland, and skeletal system.
- The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy on the tumor site on the 11th rib in January 2012 and on the central nervous system in June 2012 due to focal lesions in the right parietal and temporal lobes and the right cerebellar hemisphere.
- In May 2012, the patient started 4th line therapy with axitinib at a dose of 5 mg twice daily, achieving a partial response. However, treatment was stopped in November 2012 due to disease progression.

**Outcome:**
The total time to progression was 37.5 months, and the total survival time from the disease diagnosis was 45 months. The treatment was carried out in accordance with NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines.
