**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Consultation regarding adjuvant radiation after surgery.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred for a consultation regarding adjuvant radiation therapy following an extensive resection of a primary scalp lesion on the right side of the head. The patient initially developed the lesion approximately six years ago, which was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient was disease-free for six years until a new lesion appeared at the same site, rapidly disseminating to involve almost all scalp tissue within one month.

**Diagnostic Imaging and Findings:**  
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a vegetative and enhancing mass over the right parietal bone, measuring 74mm x 74mm x 38mm, with suspicious invasion to the external table of bone and adjacent bone marrow. Multiple suspicious lymphadenopathies were noted in the left cervical levels 2 and 5, as well as the left occipital and parotid regions, with a short axis diameter of about 10mm.

**Biopsy Results:**  
Core needle biopsy of the suspicious lymph nodes confirmed squamous cell carcinoma.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient underwent extensive scalp surgery for resection of the lesions. The surgical pathology report indicated a 9-centimeter large tumor with 2.5 cm thickness, classified as poorly differentiated SCC with lymphovascular invasive features. Perineural invasion was not detected. The deep margin of the excised tissue was affected by the tumor, but the bone trabeculae and intervening marrow were not involved. Two other suspicious lesions were resected: the right frontal lesion was actinic keratosis grade 3 (Bowen's disease), and the left parietal lesion showed early invasive SCC in a background of actinic keratosis with a thickness of 2.2 mm and a close medial margin of 3 mm.

**Planned Treatment:**  
The intended treatment is adjuvant radiotherapy to a total dose of 66 Gy with 6 MV photons. However, it was realized that such a procedure would require significant brain involvement.

**Plan:**  
Further consultation with colleagues and review of the patient's case is necessary before making a final decision on the treatment plan. The patient is advised to report any changes in condition.
