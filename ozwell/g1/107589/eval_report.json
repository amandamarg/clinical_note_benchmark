Both notes mention the initial resection six years ago, the recurrence of the lesion, the extensive surgery, and the adjuvant radiation therapy plan. They also detail the diagnostic imaging findings, biopsy results, and surgical intervention. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the radiation therapy planning and execution, including the use of EBRT and brachytherapy, while the second note is a clinical summary focusing on the consultation and planned treatment."}}
