**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. B  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Clinic:** Chest Clinic  

**Subjective:**  
Mr. B was referred to our chest clinic for evaluation of an ovoid lesion identified on a chest X-ray. He initially presented to another district general hospital one year ago with fever and an abnormality on chest radiograph. The lesion was aspirated and thought to be an abscess; he was treated with antibiotics and discharged. The aspirate showed no organisms and no malignant cells. Ten months later, Mr. B consulted his general practitioner with a six-week history of cough and left-sided chest discomfort, without sputum production, fevers, night sweats, or haemoptysis. He is an ex-smoker with a history of heavy smoking but has no known asbestos exposure. He reports no significant past medical or family history and currently lives with his male partner while working for a leading supermarket.

**Objective:**  
- **Examination:** No finger clubbing or lymphadenopathy. Chest examination revealed reduced breath sounds at the left base.  
- **Imaging:** Chest radiography and CT examination revealed a 10 cm ovoid lesion in the left lower lobe adjacent to the pleura, suggesting a fluid-filled structure. A similar-looking lesion was noted in the left adrenal.  
- **Procedures:** Underwent fiber-optic bronchoscopy; brown adherent material was seen at the orifice of the posterior and lateral segment of the left lower lobe. Washings and biopsies were negative for malignancy. Aspirations of the left lower lobe lesion and adrenal lesion yielded only blood, with cytology negative for malignancy. HIV test was negative.  
- **Biopsy:** Developed a painful 5 cm left axillary lymph node, which was biopsied and confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma suggestive of primary lung origin.

**Assessment:**  
Metastatic adenocarcinoma suggestive of primary lung origin, with lesions in the left lower lobe and left adrenal, and a metastatic axillary lymph node.

**Plan:**  
- Continue to monitor Mr. B's condition closely.
- Discuss treatment options and next steps with the oncology team.
- Ensure Mr. B is informed of any updates and follow-up requirements.
- Provide supportive care to address Mr. B's current symptoms and concerns.

**Performance Status:**  
Mr. B reports not feeling too well. We will ensure he receives the best care possible.
