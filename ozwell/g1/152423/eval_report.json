Both notes mention her bilateral hip pain, past surgical history, muscle strength, range of motion, and radiographic findings. They also discuss the patient's use of crutches for ambulation and the presence of osteoarthritis in the hip joints. The main difference is that the first note includes more detailed information about the surgical procedures (THA) and outcomes, while the second note is more focused on the current evaluation and plan for addressing the patient's pain and functional limitations."}}
