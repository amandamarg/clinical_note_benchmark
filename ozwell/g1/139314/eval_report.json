Both notes detail the initial symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment plan, including the use of Acyclovir and Tramadol, followed by a revised treatment with Streptomycin sulfate and lidocaine injections. They also describe the patient's improvement over time and the eventual outcome. The main difference is that the second note includes an outcome where the patient eventually passed away, which is not mentioned in the first note."}}
