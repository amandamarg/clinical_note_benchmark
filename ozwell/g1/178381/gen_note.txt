**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Swelling and asymmetry on the right side of the face.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports swelling on the right side of the face, which developed approximately three months ago following an infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but the treatment was ineffective. The patient was referred to our clinic due to persistent swelling.

**Past Medical History:**  
No history of congenital diseases.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- **Extraoral Examination:** Severe swelling noted on the right mandibular region without fluctuation upon palpation. Submandibular lymphadenopathy present. Skin color and appearance are normal.
- **Intraoral Examination:** A deep caries cavity was observed in the right mandibular first molar tooth. The tooth is not mobile, and there is no other damage to the oral mucosa.

**Radiographic Examination:**  
A tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone on the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone was identified, indicating Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Assessment:**  
Garre's osteomyelitis secondary to periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar.

**Plan:**  
Endodontic treatment is recommended to retain the infected tooth. However, due to the patient's financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage for endodontic treatment, the patient will be transferred to the surgical clinic for dental extraction.

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family inquired about assistance with treatment costs. It was explained that endodontic treatment is expensive and not covered by insurance, making dental extraction the most appropriate treatment option for the patient's condition.
