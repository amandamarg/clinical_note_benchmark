Both describe the case of an eight-year-old girl with swelling and facial asymmetry due to an infection in the right mandibular molar region. They mention the initial treatment with antibiotics, the ineffectiveness of that treatment, and the subsequent referral to the clinic. Both notes detail the clinical and radiographic examinations, which reveal a deep caries cavity and Garre's osteomyelitis due to a periapical infection. The treatment plan in both notes involves considering endodontic treatment but ultimately opting for dental extraction due to financial constraints. The postoperative outcome is also mentioned in both notes, indicating a return to normal bone contours and facial symmetry."}}
