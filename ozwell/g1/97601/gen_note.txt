**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. Patient  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents with a history of being shot in the face a week ago. He reports a problem with mouth opening.

**Objective:**  
- Vital signs: Stable  
- Examination reveals a left maxillary infraorbital lesion on the maxillary bone, consistent with the bullet entry hole, and a skin burn measuring 1x1 cm.  
- Restricted mouth opening observed.  
- Widespread tenderness and oedema noted on the left temporomandibular joint and left maxillary region upon palpation.  
- Facial nerve functions are intact.  
- Brain and maxillofacial tomography show multiple segmental fracture lines in the anterior and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus, zygomatic process, mandible, and pterygoid process. Diffuse air images and areas of hematoma observed in adjacent soft tissue. A metallic foreign body with a diameter of 1 cm is present in the subcutaneous fatty tissues in the posterior neighborhood of the mandible on the left side.  
- Neurosurgery evaluation for cranial pathologies showed no pathological condition.  
- Ophthalmology consultation revealed a left orbital floor fracture and minimal bleeding in the left intraorbital region.  

**Procedure:**  
The patient underwent exploration of the left parotid region under general anesthesia to remove the foreign body. The foreign body was palpated in parotid tissue after application of a modified Blair incision. The main truncus of the facial nerve was identified, and its branches were followed and preserved. The bullet was confined to the superficial lobe and was not associated with the facial nerve. After removal of the bullet, a drain was placed. No perioperative complications were observed.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Postoperative period: Facial nerve functions intact.  
- Recommend applying cold compresses and following a conservative approach.  
- Advise the patient to return for follow-up if any concerns arise.  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up if any concerns arise.
