Both describe the case of a 20-year-old male patient who suffered a gunshot injury to the face, leading to restricted mouth opening. They detail the examination findings, including stable vital signs, a left maxillary infraorbital lesion, restricted mouth opening, tenderness, and oedema in the left temporomandibular joint and maxillary region, and intact facial nerve functions. Both notes mention the findings from brain and maxillofacial tomography, the presence of a metallic foreign body, and the results of neurosurgery and ophthalmology evaluations. They also describe the procedure to remove the foreign body, noting the preservation of the facial nerve and the absence of perioperative complications. The assessment and plan in both notes recommend applying cold compresses, a conservative approach, and follow-up if concerns arise."}}
