They both describe the same patient's medical history, symptoms, and treatment plan. Both notes mention the patient's history of left side chest pain, recurrent loss of consciousness, convulsions, temporary loss of vision, hypertension, and recent skin nodules. They also detail the episodes of loss of consciousness and the treatment with albendazole, prednisone, and carbamazepine. The notes conclude with a follow-up plan and continuation of hypertension medication. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the patient's medical history, imaging findings, and treatment outcomes, while the second note is a more concise summary focusing on the chief complaint and plan."}}
