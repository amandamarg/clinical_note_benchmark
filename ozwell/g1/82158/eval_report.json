Both describe the case of a 44-year-old woman who experienced urinary problems, including dysuria and intermittent hematuria, for two years. They both mention her history with IUDs, including the unexpected pregnancy after the first IUD and the insertion of a second IUD postpartum. Both notes detail the findings from various examinations and imaging studies, including the discovery of an echogenic intravesical lesion suggestive of a foreign body or calculus. They also describe the cystoscopic evaluation and endoscopic surgery to remove the IUD and associated stone formation. The follow-up plan is also consistent in both notes. Overall, the content and sequence of events are nearly identical."}}
