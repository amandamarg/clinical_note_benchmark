Both notes mention the patient's 6-month history of right ear pain, initial clear fluid discharge turning serosanguineous, and lack of relief from ciprodex and keflex. They also describe decreased sensation on the right side of the face, right eye ptosis and paralysis, and inability to protrude the tongue. The physical examination findings, CT and MRI scan results, and the initial assessment of severe otitis media are consistent across both notes. However, the second note provides additional details about the patient's readmission, biopsy results showing squamous cell carcinoma, and the treatment plan involving chemotherapy and palliative care. Overall, the notes are similar in describing the initial presentation and findings but differ in the level of detail regarding the diagnosis and treatment plan."}}
