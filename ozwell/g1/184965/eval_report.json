They both describe the medical history and treatment of a young girl with recurrent episodes of left peripheral facial palsy and a history of pure red cell hypoplasia. Both notes mention the initial occurrence of facial palsy at age three, subsequent episodes, and the treatment with corticosteroids. They also detail the diagnosis of pure red cell hypoplasia, the suspected involvement of anti-EPO antibodies, and the autoimmune hypothesis. Additionally, both notes describe the imaging findings of a haemorrhagic stroke and the treatment plan involving corticosteroids and follow-up appointments. The main difference is the level of detail and specific wording used in each note."}}
