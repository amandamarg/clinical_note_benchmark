They both describe the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a painful swelling on the right middle finger, which had been present for about 30 years and increased in size over the past 6 months. Both notes mention the initial suspicion of aggressive adenocarcinoma, the diagnostic findings of a vascular destructive lesion, and the subsequent amputation of the middle phalanx. They also cover the histopathology results showing a high mitotic grade lesion diagnostic of ADPA, the patient's decision to decline further surgical treatment, and the development of a mass in the right axilla and pulmonary metastases 17 months later. Additionally, both notes mention the patient's intracranial hemorrhage and mild shortness of breath due to pulmonary metastasis over the past 2 years."}}
