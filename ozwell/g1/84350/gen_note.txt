**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse and developed tricuspid vegetations. She underwent a median sternotomy and tricuspid valvuloplasty one year prior to this encounter.

**Recent Medical History:**
- **Motor Vehicle Accident:** The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident 8 months ago and was thrown from the vehicle. She was intubated in the field and underwent three separate intubations for neurosurgical procedures. She was unable to be weaned from the ventilator at the end of the last procedure.
- **Tracheostomy and Hemorrhage:** A tracheostomy was performed without complication, and she was downsized from a size 6 cuffed tracheostomy to a size 6 cuffless tracheostomy on post-operative day 5. However, she had the immediate development of massive hemorrhage from her tracheostomy site and was taken to interventional radiology where a stent was placed.

**Current Presentation:**
- **Bleeding Events:** Roughly 5 months later, the patient presented with a history of two moderate volume bleeding events from her tracheostomy and expressed a desire to be decannulated.
- **Stroboscopy and CT Angiogram:** A stroboscopy was performed, showing normal vocal fold mobility with concerns for subglottic stenosis. A CT angiogram of the head, neck, and chest was ordered due to her complex medical history and known carotid stent. The angiogram showed no extravasation. The right common carotid stent was noted to be 1 cm from the take-off of the common carotid artery from the innominate and was roughly 4 cm in length.

**Emergency Presentation:**
- The next morning, the patient presented to an outside emergency department with massive hemorrhage from her tracheostomy and was transferred emergently to our University Hospital. At the time of presentation, she had no active bleeding.
- **Intervention:** A size 8 cuffed tracheostomy tube was placed to her stoma, and she was taken to the operating room for a right neck exploration.

**Outcome:**
- Unfortunately, the patient passed away following these events.

**Family Communication:**
- The patient's family was informed of her passing. The history and recent medical events were explained to them, and condolences were offered.
