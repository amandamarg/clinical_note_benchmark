**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Mass on the right middle finger.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a mass on the volar aspect of the right middle finger, present for 6 months. An incisional biopsy was previously performed but was inconclusive, and the specimen was not available for reexamination. The mass is fixed to the dermis and the flexor sheath. The patient reports no numbness and maintains full range of motion in the finger joints.

**Imaging and Procedures:**  
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing lesion adherent to the flexor sheath. An excisional biopsy was performed through a zigzag volar incision. Intraoperatively, the tumor exhibited ill-defined borders and was adherent to the dermis, flexor sheath, and both digital nerves. Partial resection of the flexor sheath was done, and the tumor was shaved off the dermis by sharp dissection. No skin excision was performed, and both digital nerves were preserved. The tumor measured 2 Ã— 1.5 cm. Postoperatively, a small area of the skin flap became necrotic but was treated conservatively.

**Pathology:**  
Histological examination revealed classic features of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), with numerous epithelioid cells arranged in clusters, trabeculae, and cords in a myxoid background. Intracytoplasmic vacuoles were present. The mitotic rate was 3/10 high power fields with focal pleomorphism. Tumor cells extended to all resection margins. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive results for CD34, CD31, and factor VIII, confirming the endothelial origin of the tumor. Tumor cells were negative for other markers.

**Management and Follow-up:**  
Due to the malignant potential of the tumor and positive resection margins, further management with wide resection of volar soft tissues and flap reconstruction was offered. The patient's family refused this option and elected for follow-up. The follow-up protocol includes local examination and radiological workup for metastasis every 6 months. The patient is now 3 years post-operation and is advised to continue with the follow-up protocol to monitor any changes.
