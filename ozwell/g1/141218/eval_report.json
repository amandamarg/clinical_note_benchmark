They both describe the case of an 8-year-old girl with a mass on the volar aspect of the right middle finger. Both notes detail the history of the mass, the inconclusive incisional biopsy, the MRI findings, the excisional biopsy procedure, and the histological examination results. They also mention the management plan, the family's decision to refuse further surgery, and the follow-up protocol. The main difference is in the format and some minor wording variations, but the content and key details are consistent across both notes."}}
