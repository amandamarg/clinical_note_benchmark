Both describe a patient experiencing headaches related to jaw tension, which began after issues with the right jaw during chewing. They both mention that the headaches are low-intensity, occur almost daily, and are exacerbated by stress. The notes also highlight the impact on the patient's enjoyment of activities and the use of analgesics, though not excessively. \n\nBoth notes include an assessment that links the headaches to chronic jaw tension and propose a treatment plan involving exercises to reduce jaw tension, with the goal of decreasing headache frequency. The treatment plan consists of multiple visits and home exercises, with follow-up visits to monitor progress. \n\nOverall, the main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of a clinical note format in the second note, but the core information and treatment plan are consistent across both notes."}}
