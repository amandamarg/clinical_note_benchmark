They both describe the medical history and treatment of a 55-year-old woman with progressive angina, hypertension, and a cardiac murmur. Both notes mention her history of dizziness, therapy refractory hypertension, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the results of various diagnostic tests, including echocardiography, nuclear exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, and CT scan. They also describe the discovery of coarctation of the aorta and the subsequent treatment with an extra-anatomical bypass. The main difference is that the clinical note includes a plan for a follow-up appointment and emphasizes the patient's compliance with treatment."}}
