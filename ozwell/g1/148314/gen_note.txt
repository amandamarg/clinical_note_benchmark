**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:39:46 PM  

**Patient Complaint:**  
The patient presented with a request to have missing teeth replaced.

**History and Examination:**  
The patient reported a history of trauma a few years ago, leading to gradual tooth loss due to periodontal problems. Examination revealed facial paralysis on the left side, affecting both upper and lower regions. The patient is unable to smile, close the left eye, or lift the left eyebrow. There is also a reduced taste sensation on the affected side. The patient has experienced gradual development of facial muscle spasms with synkinesis.

**Diagnosis:**  
Bell's palsy Grade IV on the left side, involving the ipsilateral part of the facial nerve.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The patient declined invasive treatment for Bell's palsy. A treatment plan involving complete dentures with cheek plumpers was accepted to improve facial appearance. Primary impressions for the upper and lower edentulous arches were taken, with diagnostic casts showing normal arch form without pathologic conditions. Due to weak circumoral muscles, the labial and buccal flanges of the dentures will be enhanced. Wax will be used to enhance the labial flanges, later processed with acrylic resin for economic and time efficiency. Proper physiologic impressions will be made, and occlusal rims will be fabricated from the master casts with additional wax on the labial and buccal flanges. Jaw relations and try-in verification will be conducted at a later date.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
The patient understood and accepted the treatment plan. No questions or concerns were raised.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be kept updated on the progress of the treatment.
