Both describe the case of a 25-year-old female who presented with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and bilious emesis. They detail the initial diagnostic evaluations, including liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, and MRCP, which identified a soft tissue mass near the gallbladder. Both notes describe the surgical intervention where a hemorrhagic pedunculated mass was resected, and a cholecystectomy was performed due to inflammation and potential complications. The postoperative course was uneventful in both notes, with the patient being discharged the next day and asymptomatic at follow-up. The main difference is the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of gross pathology findings in the first note."}}
