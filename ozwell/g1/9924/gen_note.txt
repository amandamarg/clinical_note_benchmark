**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mr. X presented to the hospital with complaints of chest discomfort after eating, persisting for the past eight months. He has a known history of a middle esophageal diverticulum, diagnosed via an upper gastrointestinal contrast examination at the age of 30, for which he was asymptomatic and did not receive treatment. He also has a history of pediatric asthma.

**Objective:**
- **Previous Examination (8 months ago):** The diameter of the middle esophageal diverticulum was 47 mm with an accumulation of contrast medium.
- **Gastrointestinal Endoscopy:** Revealed a diverticulum in the right wall located 30 cm from the incisor row, with the mucous membrane partially covered by white matter unstained with iodine.
- **Narrowband Imaging:** Revealed type A.
- **Biopsy:** Pathological findings showed atypical epithelium with no malignant findings.
- **High-Resolution Manometry:** Confirmed the function of the lower esophageal sphincter and normal esophageal body peristaltic wave.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of potential malignancy due to atypical epithelium. A thoracoscopic diverticulectomy is indicated.

**Plan:**
- **Surgical Procedure:** Thoracoscopic diverticulectomy will be performed with the patient in a prone position. Four trocars will be inserted into the right thoracic cavity:
  - A 12-mm trocar in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line.
  - 12-mm trocars in the seventh and ninth intercostal spaces at the level of the inferior scapular angle.
  - A 5-mm trocar in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line.
- **Thoracoscope Insertion:** Via the 12-mm port in the ninth intercostal space at the level of the inferior scapular angle.
- **Operator and Assistant Roles:** The operator will use the 12-mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the inferior scapular angle line and the 5 mm port in the seventh intercostal space on the posterior axillary line. The assistant will use the 12-mm port in the fifth intercostal space on the posterior axillary line.
- **Ventilation:** Only the left lung will be ventilated, and a pneumothorax in the right chest will be created using CO2 gas at 6 mm.
- **Follow-Up:** Post-surgery follow-up to monitor progress.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**
The patient understands the procedure and agrees to the surgical plan. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled post-surgery to ensure proper recovery and monitoring.
