Both describe the medical history, diagnostic findings, surgical plan, and follow-up for a 66-year-old male patient with a mediastinal mass and coronary artery disease. They detail the initial observation of the mass, the patient's refusal of further evaluation, the development of angina pectoris, and the subsequent decision to perform a one-stage combined operation to remove the tumors and perform coronary artery bypass grafting. Both notes also mention the surgical procedure, the histological examination findings, and the patient's recovery and follow-up plan. The main difference is in the format and presentation, with the clinical note being more structured and concise."}}
