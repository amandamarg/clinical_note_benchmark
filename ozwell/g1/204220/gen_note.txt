**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical History:** Coronary artery disease, previous stent placement  

**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up on lung nodule  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone stent placement. During a recent radiograph, a lung nodule was identified, prompting further investigation. A CT scan and bronchoscopy revealed a 9mm fatty endobronchial lesion in the bronchus intermedius above the middle lobe, with a 2cm extraluminal fatty lesion extending into the right hilum. An endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy was performed, showing benign bronchial epithelial cells. Due to the potential for a large defect with endobronchial resection, a decision was made to proceed with robotic-assisted resection of the lesion.

**Procedure:**  
The Da Vinci Xi robot was utilized to perform the resection of the endobronchial lesion and hilar mass, along with a right lower lobe superior segmentectomy. The superior segmental branch of the pulmonary artery and the superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe leading to the inferior pulmonary vein were mobilized and divided using the vascular robot stapler. The superior segmental branch of the right lower lobe bronchus was divided with the robot blue load stapler. Indocyanine green angiography was employed to delineate the borders of the superior segment of the right lower lobe, which was then divided using the robot blue load stapler. This approach facilitated access to the hilar fatty tumor, allowing for the removal of the hilar mass and subsequent resection of the endobronchial lesion with scissors.

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
Complete resection was confirmed with intraoperative bronchoscopy, which also revealed a large opening in the airway. Reconstruction of the airway was achieved by placing two 3-0 vicryl stay sutures at the proximal and distal ends of the airway, pulling the airway posteriorly away from the lesions through the posterior ports. Frozen section analysis on both lesions was negative for malignancy.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be monitored closely with follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and recovery. Further surveillance will be necessary to assess for any recurrence or complications.

**Discussion:**  
The patient was informed about the complexity of the procedure and the successful outcome, with reassurance provided regarding the negative malignancy findings. The importance of follow-up care was emphasized.
