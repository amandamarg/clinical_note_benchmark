Both describe the medical history of a 78-year-old male patient with coronary artery disease and previous stent placement, who was found to have a lung nodule. They detail the findings of a CT scan and bronchoscopy, revealing a 9 mm fatty endobronchial lesion and a 2 cm extraluminal fatty lesion. Both notes describe the decision to perform a robotic-assisted resection using the Da Vinci Xi robot, the procedure steps, intraoperative findings, and the successful outcome with no malignancy. The notes emphasize the importance of follow-up care and monitoring for recurrence or complications."}}
