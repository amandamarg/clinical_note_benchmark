Both describe the case of a 76-year-old male patient who experienced a fall from a bike, resulting in a split fracture of the left tibia lateral condyle and severe osteoarthritis in the left knee. They both mention the patient's past medical history, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery and current medication (Ecosprin). The notes detail the initial treatment with a knee slab and limb elevation, the surgical plan for a primary total knee replacement (TKR) with a stemmed tibial component, and the surgical procedure performed 40 days post-trauma. Postoperative care, including the application of a long knee brace and the initiation of weight-bearing, is also described. The follow-up outcomes, including good knee range of motion and no pain, are noted in both. The main difference is the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and sequence of events are consistent."}}
