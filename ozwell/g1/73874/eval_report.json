Both patients were hospitalized, referred to the Plastic Surgery Department for cranial reconstruction, and evaluated to be alert and oriented. They both had CT scans revealing cranial defects, and prostheses were fashioned and implanted. Post-surgery, both patients were discharged after a short hospital stay, started physical therapy, and returned to school without neurologic damage. The prostheses relieved symptoms, such as headaches, by alleviating pressure on brain tissue. The main differences are the patients' ages, the size and thickness of the cranial defects and implants, and the specific circumstances of their injuries (fall from a roof vs. motorcycle accident)."}}
