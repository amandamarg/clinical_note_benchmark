Both describe the case of a 56-year-old male patient with a persistent orocutaneous fistula following the removal of a plasmacytoma from the medial side of the left mandible three years ago. They both mention the unsuccessful previous attempts to close the fistula and the decision to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect. The surgical plan outlined in both notes is essentially the same, detailing the steps of the procedure under general anesthesia, including the excision of the fistula, preparation of healthy soft tissues, mobilization of the submandibular gland, and closure of the flap. Both notes also mention the postoperative care and the successful outcome observed at the follow-up visit."}}
