**Chief Complaint:** Persistent orocutaneous fistula.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with complaints of a persistent orocutaneous fistula. The patient has a history of a plasmacytoma removed from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago. The patient was referred to our clinic for further management of the fistula. Previous operations have been unsuccessful in closing the fistula.

**Imaging Studies:**  
CT images demonstrate a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The main reason for the persistence of the fistula is believed to be the ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula. We have decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps.

**Surgical Plan:**  
- The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia.
- Initial excision of the fistula and preparation of healthy soft tissues.
- Extension of the incision at the extraoral site to the posterior and anterior directions, following previous incision lines.
- Dissection in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible.
- Exposure of the submandibular gland and base of the mandible, with dissection of surrounding soft tissues.
- Mobilization of the gland while protecting the arteriovenous supply and duct.
- At the oral site, release of wound margins by blunt dissection and closure with mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene.
- Preparation of a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and defect area.
- Rotation of the submandibular gland through the soft tissue tunnel, preserving the pedicle.
- Suturing of the rotated gland to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization.
- Closure of the flap at the cutaneous site.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
Post-procedure instructions will be provided to the patient to ensure proper follow-up care.
