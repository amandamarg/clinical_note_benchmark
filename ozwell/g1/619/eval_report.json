Both notes detail the patient's physical examination findings, diagnostic investigations, and the unsuccessful attempt at an endovascular approach, leading to a single-stage surgical procedure. They also describe the surgical procedure and the patient's post-operative status. The main difference is that the clinical note is more concise and structured, focusing on the chief complaint, history, physical examination, investigations, assessment, plan, and current status, while the detailed case description provides a more comprehensive narrative of the patient's condition and treatment."}}
