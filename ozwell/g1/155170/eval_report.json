They both describe the case of a 23-year-old male patient with a cubitus varus deformity of the left elbow, which developed following a childhood fracture. Both notes detail the surgical procedure of a lateral wedge corrective osteotomy, during which an anomalous structure was found and identified as the radial nerve, which was severely entrapped and transected. Post-operatively, the patient exhibited radial nerve palsy, and tendon transfers were performed to address this. The notes also mention the patient's recovery and the plan for continued physical therapy and follow-up. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed surgical information, while the second note is a clinical follow-up summary."}}
