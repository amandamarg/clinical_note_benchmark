Both describe a 25-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent pain and swelling on the right cheek for three months. They mention the patient's previous orthognathic surgery, during which an orthodontic appliance was dislodged into the right cheek. Both notes detail the examination findings, including the presence of a sinus track with pus discharge and tenderness in the affected area. They also discuss the suspected cause of the symptoms being the dislodged appliance and outline the plan for its removal. The main difference is that the first note provides a more detailed narrative of the patient's history and the surgical exploration, while the second note is a clinical summary with a focus on the current assessment and plan."}}
