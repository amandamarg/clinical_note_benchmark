**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:36:43 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Irregularly placed teeth in upper and lower jaw  

**Medical and Dental History:** Noncontributory  

**Examination Findings:**  
- Asymmetrical face with straight profile and competent lips  
- Chin deviated towards the right side in occlusion due to functional shift of mandible  
- No associated signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorder  
- Molar relation: Class I on both sides  
- Class III skeletal bases with average mandibular growth pattern  
- Posterior crossbite extending from canine to first molar on the right side and on the first molars on the left side  
- Maxillary and mandibular anterior crowding with a deep bite  
- Upper midline shifted towards the left side by 3 mm  
- Lower midline shifted towards the right side by 3 mm  

**Cephalometric Analysis:**  
- Cervical vertebrae maturation index stage 3  
- Class skeletal bases due to retrognathic maxilla with retruded maxillary and mandibular anteriors  

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- Panoramic radiograph shows a full complement of teeth in the maxillary and mandibular arch except for the third molar in all quadrants, which is in almost crown completion stage  

**Model Analysis:**  
- Overjet of 1 mm  
- Overbite of 6 mm  
- Arch length deficiency of 7 mm in the maxillary arch and 5 mm in the mandibular arch  
- Asymmetric maxillary arch with constriction of 4 mm in the molar and 2.5 mm in the premolar region on the right side on the occlusalogram  

**Treatment Objectives:**  
- Correct the posterior crossbite to prevent the functional shift of the mandible towards the right side  
- Coincide the upper and lower midlines  
- Relieve the maxillary and mandibular anterior crowding  
- Achieve a normal overjet and overbite with good intercuspation  

**Planned Treatment:**  
- Treatment with an RME device to expand the arch  

**Follow-up:**  
- Patient to return in a few weeks for follow-up appointment  

**Notes:**  
- Patient advised to call with any questions or concerns in the meantime.
