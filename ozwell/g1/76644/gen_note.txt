The patient presents with a complaint of facial disfigurement on the left side, which has been present for 14 years. The condition began as a small area of hyperpigmentation on the left cheek at the age of 8 and has progressively worsened.

Evident loss of underlying fat, muscle, and subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a sunken-in appearance. Thinning of lips on the affected side with exposure of teeth due to the corner of the mouth being pulled to the left.
- **Ocular and Skin Examination:** No abnormalities or evidence of lymphadenopathy. No sensory or motor deficits on either side.
- **Palpation:** Skin on the affected side is rigid with signs of sclerosis. TMJ on the affected side is tender with deviation to the left on mouth opening.
- **Intraoral Examination:** Normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Marked atrophy of the tongue on the left side with a shift in the dorsal median fissure.
- **Hard Tissue Examination:** Crowding of teeth with a shift in midline to the affected side. Obliteration of buccal and vestibular sulcus due to tense oral tissue. Constriction of upper and lower arch with multiple carious teeth.
