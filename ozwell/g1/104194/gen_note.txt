**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. Patient  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Department:** Prosthodontics  

**Subjective:**  
Mr. Patient was referred from the department of plastic surgery for the fabrication of an auricular prosthesis for his missing right ear, which was lost due to a road traffic accident a few years ago. Initial attempts at surgical reconstruction using cartilage and alloplastic graft materials did not provide pleasing esthetics and were subsequently removed. The patient was referred for prosthetic replacement of the missing ear.

**Objective:**  
After examination and obtaining informed consent, it was agreed that a two implants' supported custom silicone auricular prosthesis is the best treatment modality. Pre-surgical cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were performed with a radiographic stent with radio-opaque markers to assess the proximity of dura, sigmoid sinuses, and other anatomical structures. The stent was modified into a surgical stent for implant placement.

Two dental implants were placed at the 11:30 and 9:30 o'clock positions, approximately 20 mm from the center of the external auditory meatus. Thinning of the basal tissue bed was performed, considering residual graft material from previous reconstruction. The implants were left to heal for 3 months.

**Assessment:**  
Post-healing CBCT scans showed tissue thickness from the implant surface to the external skin surface ranging from 7â€“11 mm. Custom healing abutments higher than 11 mm are necessary to maintain patency and prevent tissue sagging during healing.

**Plan:**  
Due to uncertainty in obtaining precise custom healing abutments, close monitoring of the healing process is required. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks. The patient was advised to contact the office with any concerns or questions in the meantime.
