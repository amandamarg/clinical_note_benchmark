Both notes describe the same clinical scenario involving Mr. Patient, who lost his right ear in a road traffic accident and was referred for a prosthetic replacement after unsuccessful surgical reconstruction. They both outline the decision to use a two-implant supported custom silicone auricular prosthesis, the use of CBCT scans for planning, the placement of dental implants, and the need for custom healing abutments. The notes also mention the follow-up plan and the absence of adverse reactions during the healing period."}}
