**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:30 PM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Persistent right cheek pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with complaints of persistent right cheek pain. The patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, which was treated until 3 months ago by an otolaryngologist. Symptoms began 6 weeks ago with high fever, sore throat, and comorbid right cheek pain and mild swelling. The patient had a dental checkup the day before the initial visit, which showed no abnormal findings. Initially diagnosed with a streptococcal infection and suspected facial cellulitis, the patient was treated with amoxicillin, which improved symptoms. However, the facial pain recurred within 4 weeks. The patient then visited another department, where recurrence of cellulitis with sinusitis was suspected, and cefditoren pivoxil treatment was initiated, but the pain persisted.

**Family History:**  
The patient's father had severe hearing impairment.

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on physical examination and laboratory tests, the patient has been clinically diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN).

**Plan:**  
Prescribe oral clarithromycin to address the sinusitis that might have caused or exacerbated TN. If clarithromycin does not alleviate symptoms, consider other treatment options.
