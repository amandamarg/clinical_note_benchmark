**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with discomfort and pain during a diagnostic barium enema, which was performed due to chronic constipation. The patient reported that the pain began immediately after the rectal tube was inserted and increased during the procedure. The patient has a medical history of chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

**Objective:**  
During the physical examination, generalized abdominal tenderness was noted, particularly in the lower quadrants, with some rebound tenderness in the hypogastric region. A digital rectal exam revealed loose, bloody stool. An emergent supine plain abdominal x-ray was performed to evaluate the pattern of the barium, which indicated the possibility of rectal perforation and spillage of barium into the surrounding tissues.

**Assessment:**  
The pattern of contrast extravasation on the x-ray suggested rectal perforation. An emergent exploratory laparotomy with a midline incision was conducted. The procedure revealed no visible perforation site in the distal colon or the sigmoid and upper rectum. However, bright drops of barium were detected on the posterior wall of the peritoneum and around the sigmoid mesocolon and the mesoileum, indicating penetration of barium into the surrounding tissues.

**Plan:**  
- The patient will remain in the hospital for a few days for further observation and treatment.  
- Adequate fluid replacement, resuscitation, and prophylactic antibiotics have been administered.  
- A follow-up appointment with a specialist will be arranged for further evaluation and treatment.  

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient was advised to stay in the hospital for observation and to follow up with a specialist. The patient was encouraged to communicate any questions or concerns.
