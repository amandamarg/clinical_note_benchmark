**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a painless and immobile mass located between the clavicle and chin on the right side of the neck.

**Objective:**  
Initial ultrasonography and tomography revealed a vascular mass originating from the carotid body. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a solid lesion in the right carotid area, approximately 80mm by 90mm by 100mm in size, with smooth contours and well-circumscribed, intense contrast enhancement. The mass was pushing the internal and external carotid artery and jugular vein.

**Assessment:**  
The mass was identified as a type II carotid body tumor, according to the Shamblin classification. Due to the large diameter of the mass and its compression on surrounding nerves and dense collaterals, embolization was performed prior to curative surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding.

**Plan:**  
Embolization was conducted under general anesthesia with subtracted fluoroscopic monitoring. The lesion was fed by multiple collaterals from the external and internal carotid arteries. OnyxÂ® glue-cast particles were used to close the vessels belonging to the tumor. The procedure resulted in a significant decrease in blood flow, and the tumor was observed to shrink in digital subtraction angiography. No complications occurred during or after the procedure. Post-embolization neck contrast-enhanced CT showed decreased intense contrast enhancement and more prominent carotid artery branches with reduced arching.

Two days post-embolization, the patient underwent surgery for curative tumor excision. The tumor was dissected without damaging the internal carotid artery and was completely removed. Follow-up will be important to ensure continued patient health and recovery.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient was advised to follow up as instructed and to reach out with any questions or concerns.
