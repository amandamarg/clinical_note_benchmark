Both describe the case of a 66-year-old female patient with a painless and immobile mass between the clavicle and chin on the right side of the neck. They detail the diagnosis of a vascular mass originating from the carotid body, identified as a type II carotid body tumor according to the Shamblin classification. Both notes mention the use of ultrasonography, tomography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography to assess the mass, which was approximately 80mm by 90mm by 100mm in size. They describe the decision to perform embolization before curative surgery due to the mass's large diameter and compression on surrounding nerves and dense collaterals. The embolization procedure involved the use of Onyx\u00ae glue-cast particles under general anesthesia and subtracted fluoroscopic monitoring, resulting in a significant decrease in blood flow and tumor shrinkage. Both notes report no complications during or after the procedure. Two days post-embolization, the patient underwent successful surgery for curative tumor excision, with the tumor being completely removed without damaging the internal carotid artery. The notes conclude with a plan for follow-up to ensure continued patient health and recovery."}}
