They both describe the same patient, a 32-year-old female, with a history of sudden onset severe headaches, generalized tonic and clonic fits, and loss of consciousness. Both notes mention her regaining consciousness after 24 hours without neurological deficits but with neck rigidity and headache. They also detail her past medical history, including trivial headaches, malaise, low-grade fever, and intermittent claudication in the upper limbs. \n\nThe physical examination findings are consistent in both notes, highlighting the absence of neurological deficits and the impalpable radial and brachial arteries bilaterally, along with blood pressure discrepancies. The investigations section in both notes reports similar findings from CT brain scans, laboratory tests, and cerebral angiography, including the occlusion of carotid and subclavian arteries and the presence of a saccular basilar tip aneurysm.\n\nBoth notes describe the treatment plan involving prednisone and the referral for endovascular coil embolization. The follow-up advice is also consistent, with a recommendation for the patient to return in one week for evaluation. Overall, the notes convey the same clinical information and patient management plan."}}
