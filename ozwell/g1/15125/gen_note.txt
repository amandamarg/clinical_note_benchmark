**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient's Name]
- Age: 32 years
- Occupation: Housewife and mother of two children

**Chief Complaint:**
- Episode of sudden onset severe headache associated with generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reported regaining consciousness after 24 hours without any neurological deficit but complained of neck rigidity and headache.
- Past history of similar episodes dating back 1 year.
- Long history of trivial headaches, malaise, and low-grade fever for the past 6 years, not previously investigated due to mild severity.
- History of intermittent claudication in bilateral upper limbs.

**Physical Examination:**
- No neurological deficit observed.
- Radial and brachial arteries impalpable bilaterally.
- Blood pressure discrepancies noted: 140/80 mmHg in the right arm and 160/80 mmHg in the left arm.

**Investigations:**
- CT brain scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
- Previous CT scan (1 year ago) showed similar findings.
- Laboratory investigations revealed raised ESR (40 mm/h) and positive C Reactive Protein.
- Cerebral angiography and aortogram showed:
  - Total occlusion of the left common carotid artery from its origin.
  - 90% occlusion of the right common carotid artery from its origin with a slightly dilated segment prior to tapering.
  - Sole intracranial circulation supplied by bilateral vertebral arteries with a saccular basilar tip aneurysm (7.30 x 5.39 mm).
  - Bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from initial segments with extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms.
  - Terminal aorta irregular, but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of the aorta normal.

**Treatment:**
- Initiated on 20 mg prednisone, resulting in reduction of ESR and normalization of C Reactive Protein.
- Referred for endovascular coil embolization due to relatively straight and accessible vertebral arteries.

**Follow-Up:**
- Patient advised to return in one week for progress evaluation.
