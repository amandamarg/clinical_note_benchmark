**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mr. X  
**Age:** 92 years  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Ulcer on the tongue for two months, painful and causing discomfort while swallowing.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. X presented with a two-month history of a painful ulcer on the tongue, which has caused significant discomfort while swallowing. He reports a weight loss of 7 kilograms over the past month, attributed to the inability to eat due to pain.

**Medical History:**  
- Age: 92 years  
- No significant past medical history reported.

**Social History:**  
- Long-term pipe smoker  
- Regular moderate alcohol consumption

**Examination:**  
- Head and neck examination revealed a 3 cm diameter indurated ulcer on the left posterior dorsum of the tongue, highly suspicious of malignancy.  
- Ipsilateral lymph node enlargement of 4 cm diameter in the level 3 region.

**Investigations:**  
- Incisional biopsy of the tongue ulcer performed under local anaesthesia.  
- Histopathology report: Suggestive of adenocarcinoma.  
- Immunohistochemistry: Positive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2; negative for cytokeratin 7, TTF1, thyroglobulin, and PSA.  
- Imaging: Chest X-ray, MRI of head and neck, and CT of chest and abdomen.  
  - CT findings: Sigmoid carcinoma with local lymphadenopathy and evidence of distant metastasis to right axillary, hepatic, intrapulmonary, retroperitoneal, brain, and bony disease to the thoracic vertebra.

**Diagnosis:**  
- The oral lesion is indicative of a distant metastasis from a primary bowel carcinoma.  
- Confirmed rectosigmoid tumour on colonoscopy, histologically a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

**Plan:**  
- Due to the extensive nature of the disease, the treatment plan is focused on palliation.  
- Patient was discussed in the head and neck multidisciplinary team meeting and referred to the colorectal team for further management.

**Discussion:**  
The patient was informed about the diagnosis and the palliative approach due to the extensive metastatic disease. Mr. X was encouraged to ask questions and express any concerns regarding his condition and treatment plan.
