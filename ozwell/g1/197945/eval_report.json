Both describe the case of a 49-year-old Caucasian woman with a lesion on her right nipple. They detail the patient's history, including the initial appearance of the lesion, its growth, and the symptoms of heat and tenderness in the right breast. Both notes mention the patient's tobacco use and the physical examination findings of an erythematous and rigid right breast with a 2.2 cm lesion on the nipple that drains yellow pus. They also describe the diagnostic studies performed, including the shave biopsy, MRI, and wedge biopsy, and the findings of squamous cell carcinoma and verrucous histologic features. The plan for wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex and the post-excision histologic findings are also included in both notes. The main difference is that the second note includes the outcome that the patient has unfortunately passed away."}}
