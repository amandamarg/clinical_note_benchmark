Both notes mention the influence of a peer group known for mischief and truancy, leading to the boy's involvement in physical fights at school and a decline in academic performance. The notes also highlight the boy's history of ADHD, which improved with sports and occupational therapy, and the absence of psychiatric disorders in the family. \n\nThe first note provides a detailed account of the boy's response to Risperidone, including the development of enuresis, and the subsequent switch to aripiprazole. The second note focuses more on the initial assessment and plan, including the initiation of Risperidone and the importance of follow-up appointments. Both notes emphasize psychoeducation for the mother and the use of behavior therapy techniques."}}
