They both describe the case of a 69-year-old female with a pulsatile mass on the right side of her neck, which was first noticed 13 years ago. Both notes mention the initial conservative treatment, the endovascular treatment with parent vessel occlusion 4 years ago, and the recent enlargement of the mass over the past 6 months. They also describe the findings from the CT angiography and 3D reconstruction, confirming a fusiform giant aneurysm of the right ICA. The notes detail the patient's decision to undergo surgical correction and the plan for post-surgery follow-up. The main difference is the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's name and the date in the clinical note."}}
