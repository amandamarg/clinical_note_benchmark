Both describe the medical history of a 74-year-old man who developed ureteral cancer and underwent a nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection in 2013. They both mention the subsequent chemoradiotherapy for para-aortic lymph node recurrence and the decision for active surveillance due to the patient's age and renal function. Both notes detail the discovery of a breast mass in February 2016, the initial diagnosis of primary breast cancer, and the eventual diagnosis of breast metastasis of ureteral cancer after surgery. They also describe the treatment choice of surgery over chemotherapy and the patient's postoperative course, including the development of lung metastases and the patient's death in July 2016. The clinical note adds a plan for regular follow-up visits and monitoring."}}
