**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:14:44 PM  

**Patient History:**
The patient has a history of ureteral cancer, for which they underwent a nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection in 2013. Post-surgery, the patient received chemoradiotherapy to address para-aortic lymph nodes recurrence. Despite treatment, the enlarged abdominal lymph nodes did not completely disappear. Due to the patient's age and renal function, further extensive therapy was not pursued, and the patient has been on active surveillance since 2015. The patient has no history of other malignancies, breast disease, or family history of carcinoma.

**Breast Mass:**
In February 2016, the patient noticed a hard, 3-cm mass with good mobility just below the right nipple. Breast ultrasonography revealed an irregular, rough, internally inhomogeneous hypoechoic mass measuring 32 × 35 mm in the center of the right breast. A tissue needle biopsy diagnosed the mass as invasive carcinoma, with negative results for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The mass increased by 1 cm in one month.

**Diagnosis and Imaging:**
The intraductal lesion around the carcinoma showed some tissue similarity to the previous ureteral cancer, but few findings suggested breast metastasis of ureteral cancer. It was initially diagnosed as primary breast cancer. Abdominal ultrasonography and chest and abdominal computed tomography showed no axillary lymph node enlargement or distant metastasis, aside from the already defined para-aortic lymph nodes enlargement.

**Treatment:**
The patient was offered preoperative chemotherapy but opted for surgery alone. A mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed in April 2016. Gross pathology revealed a nodular lesion measuring 45 × 30 × 55 mm, with tumor cells exhibiting high nuclear atypia and extremely prominent mitotic figures. No intraductal lesion was present.

**Plan:**
The patient is advised to return for regular follow-up visits and monitoring to ensure health progression is as expected. The patient was encouraged to ask questions or express concerns as needed.
