They both describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed a mass in the lower abdomen. Both notes mention her insulin dependency, the initial suspicion of a skin-related complication due to insulin injections, and the postponement of the mass excision due to a femoral neck fracture. They also describe the improvement in her blood glucose control during hospitalization, the reduction in her insulin dose, and the eventual enlargement of the mass over four years. Both notes conclude with the excision of the mass, the pathological findings of insulin injection-related local amyloidosis, and the patient's recovery. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a more concise summary of the events, while the context information offers a more detailed narrative."}}
