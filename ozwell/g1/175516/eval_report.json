Both notes detail the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and the medical procedures performed. However, there is a significant difference in the outcome described in each note. The first note states that the patient was discharged and doing well two months after the procedure, while the second note incorrectly states that the patient passed away due to complications. This discrepancy in the outcome is the primary difference between the two notes."}}
