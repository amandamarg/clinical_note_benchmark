They both detail the patient's history of headaches, the discovery of a tumor through imaging, and the subsequent biopsy confirming squamous cell carcinoma. Both notes mention the patient's mild hyperlipidemia, lack of family history of sinus cancer, and social habits. They also describe the physical examination findings and the agreed treatment plan of surgical resection followed by radiochemotherapy. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure, while the second note is a clinical summary without surgical details."}}
