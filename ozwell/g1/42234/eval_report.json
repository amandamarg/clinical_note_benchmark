Both describe the case of a 13-year-old female patient with a spontaneous rupture of a pancreatic tumor, specifically a solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas. They detail the initial presentation with sudden abdominal pain, the findings from the CT scan, the lack of history of blunt abdominal trauma, and the conservative therapy that stopped the bleeding. Both notes also describe the referral for surgical treatment, the findings upon examination at the hospital, the surgical intervention involving laparoscopic enucleation, and the postoperative course, including the confirmation of a pancreatic fistula and the patient's discharge. Additionally, both notes confirm the pathological diagnosis of SPT and mention the negative surgical margin and rupture of the tumor capsule. The plan for continued monitoring is also consistent in both notes."}}
