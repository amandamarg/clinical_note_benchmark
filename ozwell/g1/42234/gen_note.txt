**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:56:48 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Spontaneous rupture of pancreatic tumor  
- **Diagnosis:** Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with sudden onset abdominal pain and was initially taken to another hospital by ambulance. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it. The acute abdominal pain was attributed to hemoperitoneum caused by the spontaneous rupture of the pancreatic tumor. The patient had no history of blunt abdominal trauma. The tumor was diagnosed as a solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas based on CT findings, age, and gender. Conservative therapy successfully stopped the bleeding, and the patient was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment three months post-rupture.

**Examination and Findings:**  
Upon referral, the patient exhibited no abdominal symptoms, and the tumor was not palpable. A CT scan at our hospital showed a 4 cm diameter cystic tumor protruding from the pancreatic tail, distant from the main pancreatic duct, with the fluid around the tumor having disappeared.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
An elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed and performed. Laparoscopic exploration showed no peritoneal dissemination. The procedure involved the use of five trocars under pneumoperitoneum, and the pancreatic parenchyma was divided with laparoscopic coagulating shears. The operation lasted 126 minutes with minimal blood loss.

**Postoperative Course:**  
On postoperative day 3, the amylase content in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L, confirming a postoperative pancreatic fistula according to the international definition. Due to the small volume of fluid from the drain, it was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the grade A pancreatic fistula, the postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7.

**Pathological Examination:**  
The tumor was confirmed as a solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas. Microscopic examination verified a negative surgical margin and rupture of the tumor capsule.

**Plan:**  
The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in condition.
