They both mention the patient's age, gender, chief complaint of painful swelling in the left eye, history of present illness with gradual swelling and vision loss, and the examination findings of the left and right eyes. Both notes also discuss the assessment and plan for further tests and follow-up. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific format used in each note."}}
