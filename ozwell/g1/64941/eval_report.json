They both cover the patient's presentation with chest pain and shortness of breath, past medical history of coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and hypothyroidism, and recent medical events including cardiac catheterization and subsequent stroke symptoms. Both notes mention the use of nitroglycerin, the cardiac catheterization results, the sudden development of left-sided weakness and facial droop, the elevated aPTT due to unfractionated heparin, and the eventual use of tPA after aPTT normalization. They also both describe the patient's improvement and discharge plan. The main difference is in the structure and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's name and the time of the note in the second note."}}
