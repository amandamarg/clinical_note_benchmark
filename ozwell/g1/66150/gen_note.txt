**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 40 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
- Pain and restriction of movements in both shoulder joints following an epileptic convulsion.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reported to the emergency department after experiencing an epileptic convulsion. Post-convulsion, the patient experienced soreness and restricted movement in both shoulders. There was no witness to the episode, and the patient cannot clearly recall the event.

**Physical Examination:**
- Notable hollowness below the acromion process on both sides and flattening of the normal contour of the shoulders.
- The patient was able to hold the left arm in external rotation and abduction and the right arm in slight internal rotation.
- No peripheral neurological deficit observed.

**Radiographic Findings:**
- Anterior shoulder dislocation with a displaced greater tuberosity fracture on the left side.
- Posterior dislocation with a lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side.
- Both dislocations were promptly reduced by closed manipulation in the emergency department.
- Post-reduction radiographs showed persistent but decreased displacement of both tuberosities, more pronounced on the left side.
- CT scan performed for better demonstration of the fracture pattern.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Preoperative workup, anesthetic evaluation, physician consultation, and informed consent were completed.
- Surgery was performed to fix the lesser tuberosity fracture on the right side using two partially threaded cannulated screws via a deltopectoral approach.
- The greater tuberosity fracture on the left side was fixed using two partially threaded cannulated screws via a direct lateral approach.

**Postoperative Course:**
- Both shoulders were immobilized in a shoulder immobilizer for three weeks.
- Physical therapy was initiated as tolerated by the patient at four weeks.
- The patient was able to resume daily activities by two months post-surgery.

**Follow-up:**
- At one year follow-up, the patient was free of pain in both shoulder joints.
- Radiographs showed consolidation at the fracture site with no re-dislocations during the follow-up period.
- After aggressive physiotherapy, the range of motion was near normal on the left side, with a slight limitation of abduction (range of 0-120 degrees).

**Plan:**
- Continue with physiotherapy.
- Follow up if any concerns arise.
