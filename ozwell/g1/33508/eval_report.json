Both notes detail the diagnostic findings, including the results of the electrocardiogram, heart echo, coronary angiography, and coronary CT angiography. They also describe the decision-making process and the surgical intervention performed, including the ligation of the fistula and coronary artery bypass grafting. The follow-up and postoperative outcomes are also consistent between the two notes. Overall, the content and sequence of events are closely aligned."}}
