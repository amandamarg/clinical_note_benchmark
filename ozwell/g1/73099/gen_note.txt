**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:03:19 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB)  
- **Family History:** Sister also diagnosed with DEB  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Painful swallowing of solids  

**History of Present Illness:**  
- The patient reports experiencing dysphagia for the past two months.  
- The patient has a history of episodic and periodical dysphagia since the age of nine, with deterioration noted at the age of nineteen, leading to a diet primarily consisting of liquids and soft consistency meals.  
- Occasional heartburn since the age of four.  
- Mild esophageal bleeding episodes in the past.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Diagnosed with DEB at eight years old, with single blisters present since six months of age.  
- Endoscopic esophageal dilatation performed in 1997, which improved swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow test one year post-procedure revealed esophageal constriction at the same level.  
- Diagnosed with hematochezia and pain in the hypogastrium in 2014. Colonoscopy revealed nonspecific inflammatory infiltration in the ascending colon and terminal part of the ileum.  
- Complained of hemoptysis three years ago, with a suspicion of bleeding to pulmonary alveoli in the course of DEB, though a CT scan did not confirm bleeding.  
- Diagnosed with chest pain and elevated troponin I levels two months ago, but electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The patient refused coronarography.  

**Plan:**  
- Conduct a physical examination and run diagnostic tests to determine the cause of painful swallowing.  
- Advise the patient to avoid solid foods and consume liquids and soft consistency meals in the meantime.
