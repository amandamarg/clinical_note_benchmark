They both describe the medical history and current condition of a 42-year-old man with end-stage renal disease due to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Both notes mention his multiple emergency room admissions for intermittent dialysis, the cardiac event requiring intubation, and the discovery of a bulky hard mass on his palate during extubation. They also detail the CT scan findings of severe enlargement of the maxilla and mandible, the laboratory findings of elevated creatinine levels, low glomerular filtration rate, and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The diagnosis of uremic leontiasis ossea is mentioned in both notes, as well as the recommendation for a follow-up appointment with a specialist."}}
