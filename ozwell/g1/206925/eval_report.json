Both notes mention the initial diagnosis, the patient's symptoms, the surgical procedure performed, and the follow-up plan. They also include details about the biopsy findings, the function of the esophagus, and the outcome of the surgery. The main difference is that the clinical note provides a structured format with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections, while the context information is more narrative and detailed about the surgical procedure."}}
