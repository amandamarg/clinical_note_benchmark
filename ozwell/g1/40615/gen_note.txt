**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Injury:** Cut from a circular saw in the right thigh at work.
- **Location of Injury:** Medial, posterior part of the right thigh.
- **Initial Condition:** Significant blood loss, brought to the emergency room in shock but awake.

**Emergency Treatment:**
- **Vascular Repair:** Damage to the femoral artery and vein was repaired immediately, restoring circulation to the leg and foot within three hours of injury.

**Postoperative Findings:**
- **Day After Surgery:** Loss of sensory and motor function corresponding to the area of the sciatic nerve below the point of injury.
- **Third Postoperative Day:** Exploration revealed the sciatic nerve was transected. After trimming the nerve ends, a gap of 3–4 cm was noted.

**Nerve Repair:**
- **Graft Harvesting:** Sural nerve from the injured leg was harvested and divided into eight segments (5 for the tibial component, 3 for the peroneal component).
- **Graft Application:** Grafts were applied with the knee in an extended position, fixed with single 9–0 sutures and tissue glue (Tissel®).

**Rehabilitation:**
- **Initial Phase:** Leg immobilized in semi-flexion for four weeks. Initial rehabilitation proceeded without complication.
- **Supportive Measures:** Use of an orthosis during daytime for support and to hold the foot up. Physical therapy was conducted to counter contractions. Sensory re-education was performed.
- **Complications:** Tendency towards plantar flexion contracture, especially in the mornings, treated with an orthosis during the night.

**Physical Therapy Goals:**
- Encourage counter contractions in the leg.

**Progress Monitoring:**
- **Motor Function Measurement:** Continuous improvement of muscle force measured according to the British Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.

**Final Follow-Up:**
- At 58 months, the patient exhibited above the muscle force.

**Conclusion:**
The patient has made significant progress. Continued monitoring and support will be provided to ensure ongoing recovery and improvement.
