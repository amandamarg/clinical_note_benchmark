Both notes mention the patient's past surgical history, the diagnostic tests performed (CT scan, VEP test, and MRI), and the treatment administered (steroid therapy). They also discuss the potential causes of the optic nerve injury and the rarity of such complications, especially under local anesthesia. Additionally, both notes emphasize the importance of monitoring the patient's condition and following up with an eye doctor. The main difference is in the format and structure, with one being a clinical note and the other providing more detailed context and analysis of similar cases."}}
