Swelling and asymmetry on the right side of the face.

**Oral Examination:**
- Deep caries cavity in the right mandibular first molar tooth.
- Tooth is not mobile.
- No other damage to the oral mucosa.

**Radiographic Examination:**
- Tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone on the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, indicating Garre's osteomyelitis due to periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Assessment:**
- Garre's osteomyelitis secondary to periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar.

**Plan:**
- Endodontic treatment is recommended to retain the infected tooth. However, due to the patient's financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage for endodontic treatment, the patient will be transferred to the surgical clinic for dental extraction.

**Family Discussion:**
- The patient's family inquired about assistance with the cost of treatment. It was explained that endodontic treatment is expensive and not covered by insurance, making dental extraction the most appropriate treatment option given the circumstances.
