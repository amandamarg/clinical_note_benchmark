They both describe the case of an eight-year-old girl with swelling and facial asymmetry due to an infection in the right mandibular molar region. Both notes mention the history of the illness, the clinical and oral examination findings, the radiographic examination results, and the assessment of Garre's osteomyelitis. They also discuss the treatment plan, which involves dental extraction due to financial constraints. The main difference is in the formatting and slight variations in wording, but the content and medical details are consistent across both notes."}}
