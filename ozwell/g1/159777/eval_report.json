Both notes discuss a 75-year-old female patient with a painless intra-oral growth in the right mandibular alveolar region, leading to difficulty in closing the mouth and chewing. They both mention the patient's history of exfoliation of teeth, moderate visual and hearing impairment, and the referral to maxillofacial surgery after a dental camp consultation.\n\nThe first note provides a detailed account of the examination, diagnosis, and treatment, including the excisional biopsy and histopathological confirmation of a pyogenic granuloma. It also mentions the follow-up and lack of recurrence.\n\nThe second note is more concise, focusing on the patient's chief complaint, history, and a brief physical examination. It outlines a plan for a biopsy, antibiotics for the odor, and a follow-up appointment.\n\nOverall, the notes are similar in describing the patient's condition and treatment but differ in the level of detail and specific information provided."}}
