**Time:** 7:16:01 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Growth in the mouth causing difficulty in closing the mouth completely.  
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient reports noticing a small, painless growth inside the oral cavity in the right mandibular alveolar region approximately a year and a half ago. The growth has gradually increased in size, leading to difficulty in closing the mouth and chewing food. The patient also reports a fetid odor from the oral cavity for the past few months.  
- **Medical History:** History of exfoliation of mandibular teeth and a few maxillary teeth due to extensive mobility. No known drug allergies.  
- **Referral Information:** The patient was referred to our outpatient department of maxillofacial surgery following a consultation at a dental education camp held in their village.  
- **Visual and Hearing Impairment:** Moderate visual and hearing impairment reported by the patient.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- **Oral Examination:** A smooth-surfaced, lobulated growth approximately 5 × 4 × 2 cm in size was observed, covering the alveolar ridge from the midline to the molar region on a completely edentulous alveolar ridge. The growth is pedunculated and freely movable over the peduncle, which is present on the alveolar ridge of the premolar region. The surface of the growth is smooth, showing normal color in certain areas, while the superior surface in some areas is covered by yellowish plaque-like material. There is a mild indentation of the maxillary teeth. The growth is slightly visible when the patient protrudes the tongue and is not causing any pain.  

**Plan:**  
- Perform a biopsy to determine the exact cause of the growth.  
- Prescribe antibiotics to address the fetid odor.  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review biopsy results and assess the effectiveness of the antibiotics.
