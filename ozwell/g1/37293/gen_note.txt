**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:26:25 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Medical History:** Epilepsy since childhood, well controlled by medication. Laparoscopic appendectomy one year ago.

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Abdominal pain for the past five days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing intermittent, colicky abdominal pain for the past five days, accompanied by a sense of fullness in the lower abdomen and pelvis. The patient also reports nausea and vomiting but denies any fever, changes in urinary symptoms, or vaginal bleeding.

**Physical Examination:**  
- The patient was alert and conscious during the examination.  
- Vital signs were stable.  
- Abdominal examination revealed distension with a palpable pelvic-abdominal mass that was hard, non-tender, and slightly mobile.  
- Liver and spleen were within normal range.  
- Digital rectal examination showed no abnormalities.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- **CT Scan of Abdomen and Pelvis:** Revealed a pelvic/abdominal mass adjacent to the distal small bowel loops, separate from the uterus and ovaries, heterogeneously enhancing, measuring approximately 65 Ã— 99 mm with multiple areas of necrosis.  
- **CT Scan of Chest:** Showed indeterminate multiple bilateral subpleural lung nodules measuring 2 mm to 4 mm, too small to biopsy.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The multidisciplinary tumor board discussed the case and advised confirming the diagnosis to eliminate the possibility of an ovarian origin of the tumor due to its close proximity. Surgical exploration is indicated to investigate the large mass, which has both cystic and solid components, to rule out lymphoma or tuberculosis, common in the population. There is radiological confusion regarding the origin of the mass, and a histological biopsy is necessary for confirmation. Surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible. The patient is advised to rest and take it easy in the meantime.
