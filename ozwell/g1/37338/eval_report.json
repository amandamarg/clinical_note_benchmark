Both describe the medical history and recent events of an 86-year-old woman who presented with severe upper abdominal pain. They detail her past medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a history of omphalocele repair. Both notes mention the incidental diagnosis of a pancreatic serous cystadenoma 10 years ago and the patient's regular follow-up for six years, which she stopped attending four years ago. \n\nUpon her recent admission to the emergency department, both notes describe inconclusive chest and abdominal x-rays, laboratory findings of marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and high blood glucose levels. They also mention the intravenous contrast CT scan revealing free peritoneal air and fluid, a large mass originating from the stomach, and secondary liver lesions. \n\nThe surgical intervention described in both notes includes an urgent laparotomy revealing a prepyloric ulcer perforation and a large inoperable mass from the pancreatic body invading the stomach and liver. The pathology findings are consistent in both notes, describing cystic lesions with a hyalloid collagenous matrix and cuboidal epithelial cells, leading to the diagnosis of serous microcystic adenoma with malignant features due to the invasive pancreatic mass and hepatic metastasis. \n\nBoth notes conclude with the patient's recovery from surgery and subsequent death a month later due to unrelated medical issues, and the plan for follow-up with a specialist."}}
