Both describe the case of a 28-year-old woman who experienced two transitory episodes of language impairment and mild confusion. They both mention that the neurologic examination, brain CT scan, and EEG findings were unremarkable, leading to a suspicion of a transient ischemic attack. Both notes detail the carotid duplex ultrasound examination revealing a parallel arterial flow resembling a double lumen and the subsequent magnetic resonance angiography that excluded carotid artery dissection but identified an arterial branch arising from the post-bulbar internal carotid artery. They also discuss the potential anatomic variants of the external carotid artery and the use of the temporal tap maneuver. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed context and discussion about the findings and procedures, while the second note is a clinical note summarizing the patient's subjective and objective information, assessment, plan, and follow-up."}}
