They both describe the case of a 21-month-old boy with a congenital epidermoid cyst on the right helix, detailing the initial presentation, surgical procedure, histological examination, diagnosis, and follow-up. Both notes mention the presence of a mass since birth, recent size increase, surgical removal under general anesthesia, histological findings, and the recurrence of similar masses approximately one year post-surgery. The main difference is the format and slight variations in wording, but the content and medical details are consistent."}}
