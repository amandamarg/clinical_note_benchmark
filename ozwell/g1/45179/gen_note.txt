**Patient Name:** [Patient Name]

**Physician:** [Doctor Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Abdominal pain and vomiting for several days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a history of abdominal pain that started gradually one day prior to admission and became more intense over time. The pain was intermittent. The patient also experienced several episodes of vomiting. The patient has a history of hernia repair 15 years ago with a lower midline incision.

**Physical Examination:**  
The lower abdomen was slightly distended with mild tenderness to palpation.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
Initial CT scan revealed dilated loops of small intestine with a small amount of ascites, leading to a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction.

**Hospital Course:**  
An exploration was performed, and adhesions were lysed. A small bowel perforation was found and repaired conventionally. On postoperative day 1, the patient experienced a temperature increase to 39Â°C, which resolved without treatment. On postoperative day 6, the patient's abdominal pain persisted and intensified. A subsequent CT scan showed a small fluid collection with some air, prompting another exploration. During this exploration, abscesses were found in the abdominal wall and between loops of small bowel, along with a site of perforation. The perforation was resected and repaired with a primary anastomosis.

The postoperative course was uneventful except for persistent anorexia. Ten days after the second exploration, a CT scan was performed due to persistent anorexia, revealing edematous small intestine and dilatation of the mesenteric veins. A filling defect in the superior mesenteric vein was suggestive of a thrombus. There was no evidence of intestinal gangrene or peritonitis. The patient was started on systemic heparin.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
1. Small bowel obstruction with perforation and abscess formation - managed with surgical exploration, resection, and repair.
2. Thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein - initiated systemic heparin therapy.
3. Persistent anorexia - continue monitoring and supportive care.

The patient was informed of the findings and treatment plan. Further questions or concerns were addressed.
