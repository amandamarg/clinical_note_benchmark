Both describe the case of a 45-year-old man who sustained a left knee injury while skiing. They detail the clinical examination findings, imaging results, medical history, surgical intervention, and postoperative care. Both notes mention the complete tear of the MCL and rupture of the patellar tendon, the surgical repair techniques used, and the rehabilitation plan. The main difference is in the level of detail provided, with the first note being more comprehensive and including specific surgical techniques and follow-up outcomes."}}
