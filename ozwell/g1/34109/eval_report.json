Both notes mention the discovery of an abnormal cardiac shadow on a chest X-ray, the presence of multiple mediastinal tumors, and the identification of a cardiac tumor originating from the posterior wall of the left atrium. They also describe the surgical plans and the findings from various imaging studies, such as CT, MRI, and TEE. The main difference is that the first note provides a detailed narrative of the patient's medical journey, including the surgical procedures and histopathological findings, while the second note is a clinical summary with subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
