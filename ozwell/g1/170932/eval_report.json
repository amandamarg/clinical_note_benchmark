Both notes mention the following key points:\n\n1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is asymptomatic with a normal physical examination.\n2. **Lesion Description**: An abdominal ultrasound and MRI revealed a right adrenal lesion, described as a soft tissue encapsulated mass measuring approximately 10 x 9 cm.\n3. **Endocrinological Evaluation**: Both notes discuss the need for an endocrinological evaluation to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and check for hyper secretion of catecholamines.\n4. **Surgical Plan**: They both mention the consideration of a laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy, detailing the procedure and the care taken during surgery.\n5. **Patient Education and Support**: Both notes emphasize the importance of patient education and encourage the patient to bring family members for support.\n\nThe main difference is that the first note provides a detailed account of the surgical procedure and histological findings, while the second note is more of a clinical summary with a focus on the patient's subjective feelings, objective findings, assessment, and plan."}}
