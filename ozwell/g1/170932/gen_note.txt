**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:23:57 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay but expresses nervousness about the test results. No other symptoms were reported.

**Objective:**  
- Abdominal ultrasound results indicate a right adrenal lesion measuring 9 cm in diameter.  
- The lesion is described as a soft tissue encapsulated mass of 10 x 9 cm in the right adrenal gland.  
- The patient is asymptomatic, and the physical examination was normal.

**Assessment:**  
- Right adrenal lesion identified.  
- Further evaluation is necessary to determine the nature of the lesion (secreting vs. non-secreting).

**Plan:**  
1. Conduct an endocrinological evaluation to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and check for hyper secretion of catecholamines.
2. Based on the endocrinological evaluation:
   - If non-secreting, proceed with an adrenal scan for further information.
   - If secreting, perform additional tests to identify specific hormones and determine appropriate treatment.
3. Consider laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy:
   - Procedure involves inserting trocars into the abdomen and removing the mass through a small incision.
   - Special care will be taken during dissection, with specific trocar placement for retraction and irrigation.
4. Schedule surgery after completing necessary tests and scans.
5. Patient is encouraged to bring family to the next appointment for support.

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule further tests and scans as soon as possible.
- Keep the patient informed throughout the process.  

**Patient Education:**  
- Discussed the routine nature of the laparoscopic procedure and reassured the patient regarding the care taken during surgery.  
- Encouraged the patient to bring family members to the next appointment for support.
