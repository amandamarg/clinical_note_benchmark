They both describe the case of a 9-year-old girl experiencing a frequent and loud popping sound in her right hip, which started after her parents' separation. Both notes mention that the popping is painless, occurs at night, and was disturbing the family's sleep. They describe the maneuver the patient uses to produce the popping and the subsequent relocation of the hip. Both notes also mention the normal findings in the patient's past medical history, family history, and developmental history, as well as the normal results from routine lab tests and radiographs. Additionally, both notes discuss the referral to psychological consultation and the resolution of the popping after family therapy. The main difference is that one note is a clinical note with specific headings, while the other is a narrative description."}}
