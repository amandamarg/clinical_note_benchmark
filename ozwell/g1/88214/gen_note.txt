**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Procedure:** Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery  

**History:**
- The patient has a history of diabetes with neuropathy, early stage nephropathy, and retinopathy.

**Pre-operative Findings:**
- Echocardiogram showed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 51%.
- Right ventricle size was normal with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

**Intraoperative Details:**
- Standard monitors were placed, and the patient was preoxygenated.
- Anesthesia was administered using midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuronium, followed by intubation and maintenance with sevoflurane and a continuous infusion of remifentanil.
- An arterial line, a central venous catheter, and a sheath for the PA catheter were inserted in the right internal jugular vein.
- Hemodynamics were stable throughout the insertion of the catheters.

**PA Catheter Insertion:**
- The PA catheter was advanced to the right ventricle at a depth of 40 cm, and then to the pulmonary artery at a depth of 55 cm.
- Difficulty in obtaining a stable pulmonary artery waveform; distal and proximal ports presented identical waveform patterns.
- Suspected mechanical problem with the catheter was ruled out after flushing saline in each lumen, which changed each waveform independently.
- The catheter was firmly in place at 15 cm depth, and attempts to remove it using flushing of cold saline and placement of a guide wire were unsuccessful.
- Portable fluoroscopy was used to visualize the catheter in situ, revealing a rare malposition.

**Plan:**
- Monitor the patient closely for any changes due to the malposition of the PA catheter.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few days to assess the patient's recovery and address any issues that may arise.
- Advise the patient to rest and recover from the surgery.
