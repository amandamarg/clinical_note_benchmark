**Chief Complaint:**  
Sharp chest pain on the left side for the past few days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing sharp chest pain on the left side, which began last night and worsened throughout the night. The pain was exacerbated by stress at home and radiated to the left shoulder. The pain was not relieved by rest. The patient has experienced mild left-sided chest pains over the past few months, typically occurring with stress or exertion, but did not seek medical attention as the pain was transient and resolved on its own after a few minutes.

**Past Medical History:**

- Occasional alcohol consumption.

**Medications:**

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient presents with chest pain and a history of elevated cholesterol, with recent findings of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and apical wall motion abnormality. Despite normal cardiac biomarkers and no coronary obstruction, continued monitoring is necessary. Further evaluation and management will be based on ongoing assessment and test results.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely, and further communication will be maintained to ensure appropriate management and care.
