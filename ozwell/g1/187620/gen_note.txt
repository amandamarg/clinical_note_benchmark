**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented with chest pain and dyspnoea.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reported experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. There are no pre-existing medical conditions.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Feeble femoral pulses were noted.
- The patient was hypertensive with marked differences in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs.
- Systolic blood pressure: 190mmHg in the upper limb and 75mmHg in the lower limb.
- Severe left ventricular hypertrophy was identified.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Echocardiography confirmed severe left ventricular hypertrophy, a tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation, and an aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm. Left ventricular function is preserved.
- Computerised tomography angiography (CTA) revealed an aortic root aneurysm of 8.8 cm and severe aortic coarctation with a lumen less than 6 mm in size.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient was diagnosed with an aortic root aneurysm and severe aortic coarctation. A two-staged hybrid approach was initially planned. The first phase involved an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage for surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. However, the first stage was unsuccessful via the femoral approach due to complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus.

A decision was made to proceed with a single-stage surgical approach to treat both lesions. Arterial lines were placed in the left radial and left femoral artery. Incisions were made in the right infraclavicular and right groin area to establish peripheral arterial cannulation access to the right axillary and right femoral artery. An 8mm dacron was used to repair the aortic root aneurysm, and the coarctation was successfully stented.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely with follow-up appointments to ensure improvement. The patient was advised to contact the medical team immediately if experiencing any symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
