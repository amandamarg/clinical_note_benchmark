They both describe the case of an eight-year-old girl with swelling and facial asymmetry in the right mandibular molar region due to an infection. Both notes detail the patient's history, clinical examination findings, radiographic examination results, diagnosis of Garre's osteomyelitis, and the treatment plan involving dental extraction due to the prohibitive cost of endodontic treatment.
