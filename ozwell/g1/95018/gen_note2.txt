**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. B  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mr. B reports feeling okay today. He has a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) initially presented with microscopic hematuria in 1986, discovered during a routine urinalysis. He was subsequently diagnosed with RCC through imaging and underwent nephrectomy for a 7 × 6 × 5.5 cm tumor.

**Objective:**
In March 2006, a routine chest X-ray revealed new lung nodules, prompting a CT scan that showed a large retroperitoneal mass posterior to the stomach and bilateral lung nodules, with the largest lung lesion measuring 2 cm. A biopsy confirmed RCC, while MRI of the brain and bone scan were negative.

Mr. B was first seen at our institution in April 2006 and was determined to be a candidate for high-dose IL-2. After 8 weeks, he showed some response but could only tolerate half of cycle 2 and subsequently declined further IL-2 treatment. He was then started on sorafenib, showing a minor response at all disease sites, and after 24 weeks on therapy, he had a significant response.

However, he developed symptomatic mTOR interstitial pneumonitis, leading to the discontinuation of temsirolimus. His disease continued to progress off therapy. In October 2008, he was started on bevacizumab, and after 24 weeks of treatment, he was found to have a pulmonary embolus. Lovenox was initiated, and bevacizumab was continued without incident.

**Assessment:**
- History of renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the lungs and retroperitoneal area.
- Previous treatments include nephrectomy, high-dose IL-2, sorafenib, and temsirolimus.
- Current treatment with bevacizumab and management of pulmonary embolus with Lovenox.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring Mr. B's response to bevacizumab.
- Continue anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.
- Schedule follow-up appointments to assess disease progression and treatment tolerance.
