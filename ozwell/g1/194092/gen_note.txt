**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient presented with a right groin bulge that developed 6 weeks ago. Initially, the patient experienced sharp pain, but has been asymptomatic since then.

**Physical Examination:**
- A 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpated in the right groin, just lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**
- Computed tomography scan revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.

**Laboratory Testing:**
- White blood cell count: 4.7 × 10^9/L.

**Assessment:**
- Right inguinal hernia with appendix involvement.

**Plan:**
- Surgical intervention was recommended and the patient agreed to proceed with the surgery.

**Surgical Procedure:**
- A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and found to consist of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance.
- The base of the appendix was seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity.
- A relaxing incision was made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum was entered to facilitate reduction of the appendix.

**Intraoperative Findings:**
- Chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented the initial reduction of the appendix.

**Complications:**
- No complications occurred during the procedure.

**Postoperative Plan:**
- The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks post-surgery.
- Follow-up appointment will be scheduled to monitor recovery and ensure proper healing.

**Family Discussion:**
- The cause of the hernia is unknown, with no implantation of mesh during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
- The family was informed about the procedure and postoperative care requirements.
