They both describe the medical case of a 72-year-old male patient, Mr. Johnson, who was referred to the clinic with bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand. Both notes detail his medical history of hypertension, the findings from physical examination, ultrasound, Doppler examination, and CT angiography, and the assessment of giant fusiform aneurysms in both axillary arteries. They also mention the initial plan for endovascular closure, the challenges faced due to the size and tortuosity of the aneurysms, and the decision for close monitoring. The family communication and the signature by Dr. Smith are also included in both notes."}}
