**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. Johnson  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension for 4 years  
- No history of trauma  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Palpable pulsatile masses in both axillae  

**Ultrasound Findings:**  
- Right axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 12-cm segment measuring 67 x 45 mm with a thrombus at the edge of the aneurysm lumen.  
- Left axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 9-cm segment with a thrombus surrounding the lumen and a turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center.  
- Hyperechogenic mass adjacent to the right aneurysm.  

**Doppler Examination:**  
- Thrombus surrounding the lumen with turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center.  
- Aneurysmal segment continuous with the brachial artery.  

**CT Angiography Findings:**  
- Giant fusiform aneurysms detected:  
  - Right axillary artery: 140 x 77 mm  
  - Left axillary artery: 93 x 45 mm  
- Thrombi present in both aneurysms, allowing flow in the lumen.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has giant fusiform aneurysms in both axillary arteries with a high risk of aneurysm rupture. The patient is symptomatic, and endovascular closure was initially planned. However, appropriate-sized stents could not be found for the large and tortuous aneurysms.

**Plan:**  
- Close monitoring of the patient's condition.  
- Regular check-ups to ensure stability and prevent complications.  

**Family Communication:**  
The patient's family was informed about the findings and the plan for close monitoring. They expressed appreciation for the care and attention provided.
