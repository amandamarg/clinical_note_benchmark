**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Discharging wound in the upper part of the abdomen for the past month.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a discharging wound in the upper abdomen. The issue began six months ago following an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college due to three days of abdominal pain. A small peptic perforation was detected and repaired with an omental patch. On the fourth post-operative day, the patient developed a burst abdomen, which was managed conservatively. The bowel eventually recovered, and the patient was put on oral nutrition and discharged. However, the abdominal wound did not heal properly.

In the fourth month post-surgery, the wound was covered with a split thickness skin graft, with no complications during the procedure or post-operative period. In the fifth month, a serous discharge was noticed from a small ulcer on the upper part of the grafted surface. The discharge was small in amount, and the patient managed it by applying gauge pieces over the wound, changing them once or sometimes two to three times a day.

**Physical Examination:**  
- **Abdomen:** A 12 cm × 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft is present over the middle of the abdomen. A small depressed ulcer of approximately 1 cm × 1 cm is noted in the upper part of the graft, covered with pale granulation and showing serous ooze. Additional spots with exuberant pale granulation are observed. The patient reports discomfort in the area. Palpation reveals a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**  
- **Blood Reports:** Hemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl, Total WBC count: 11.6 × 10^3/mm^3, Total serum protein: 7.9 gm/dl, Serum albumin: 3.5 gm/dl.
- **Ultrasound:** Left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm × 7 cm.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The current presentation suggests a possible missed pathology from the previous surgery. Further tests, including a CT scan, are recommended to better assess the area and determine the appropriate course of action. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled, and consultation with a wound care specialist may be necessary. The patient's family will be kept informed of the progress as needed.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment and undergo further imaging tests. The patient is encouraged to report any new symptoms or concerns promptly.
