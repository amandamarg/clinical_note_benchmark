The patient presents with complaints of headaches and tingling in the lower extremities, which began 5 days ago. The patient has a history of chronic hypertension and has been on hydrochlorothiazide/Valsartan for 10 years. The patient reports a recent worsening of hypertension and was seen in the outpatient setting where aggressive medical therapy was initiated.

- Vascular surgery evaluation found significant stenosis in the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
- Aortography and selective angiography revealed a stenosis measuring 5 mm at its celiac origin.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has significant vascular findings, including renal artery stenosis and aortic stenosis, contributing to the worsening hypertension and current symptoms. It is recommended that the patient follow up with vascular surgery for further evaluation and management. Continuation of aggressive medical therapy for hypertension is advised.
