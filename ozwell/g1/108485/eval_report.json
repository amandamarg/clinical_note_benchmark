Both notes mention the history of trauma with a wooden thorn, the subsequent reduction in mouth opening, and the diagnostic findings from CT and MRI scans indicating ossification. They also discuss the past medical history of pain and swelling in the left thigh, misdiagnosis, and surgery leading to immobility of the left leg. The diagnosis of Myositis Ossificans Traumatica (MOT) and the plan for further tests and precautions are also consistent in both notes. The main difference is that the first note provides more detailed information about the full-body examination and the conclusion of Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), while the second note focuses on the immediate clinical findings and plan."}}
