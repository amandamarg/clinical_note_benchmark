**Chief Complaint:**  
Difficulty in opening mouth for the past two years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports difficulty in opening the mouth, which began two years ago following a trauma involving a wooden thorn on the left cheek. The thorn was removed by a surgeon immediately, but since then, the patient's ability to open the mouth has progressively reduced.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** Revealed a radiodense mass extending in front of the anterior border of the ramus of the mandible, suggesting an ossified masseter muscle.
- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Showed a large elongated T1-T2 intermediate signal intensity lesion with mild surrounding edema in the substance of the left masseter muscle. The lesion is abutting the ramus of the left mandible, likely representing heterotopic bone formation.

**Diagnosis:**  
Myositis Ossificans Traumatica (MOT) based on the history of trauma and imaging findings.

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient's father reported a history of pain and swelling in the left thigh region and limited movement of the left leg three years ago when the patient was two years old. The patient consulted an orthopedic surgeon, and radiographs showed bony growth over the femur. Subsequent X-rays taken at one-month intervals showed progressive ossification. The patient was misdiagnosed and underwent surgical removal of the bony growth in 2016, resulting in total immobility of the left leg. Postoperative radiographs showed cord-like ossification of the muscles and soft tissue of the left leg, resembling a branching tree pattern.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Local examination of the face showed reduced mouth opening to nil.
- Full-body examination revealed ossifications.

**Plan:**  
Schedule further tests to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. Advise the patient to avoid any further trauma to the affected area.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for additional tests, and results will be reviewed together to determine the appropriate treatment plan.
