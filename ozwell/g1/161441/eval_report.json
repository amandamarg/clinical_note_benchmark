Both describe the case of a 12-year-old male who sustained an elbow injury from a fall on an outstretched hand. They detail the initial symptoms, including swelling and a hard bony lump on the medial aspect of the elbow, weakness in the fourth and fifth fingers, and decreased sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution. Both notes mention the radiograph findings of a fracture in the radial neck and dislocation of the radial head, the surgical intervention with open reduction and fixation using a mini fragment T plate, and the post-surgery discovery of an ulnar nerve injury. They also describe the patient's follow-up, range of motion, satisfaction with elbow function, and the X-ray findings of a suspicious developing proximal radioulnar synostosis. The plan for monitoring, active mobilization exercises, and protection of the arm is also consistent in both notes."}}
