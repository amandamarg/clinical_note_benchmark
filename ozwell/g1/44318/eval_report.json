Both describe the case of a 55-year-old male with a gradually enlarging lump in the left side of the abdomen over a period of 5 months, associated with dull aching pain and occasional vomiting. They both mention the findings from ultrasonography and CT scan, which revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass occupying the whole abdomen and pelvis, with the left kidney not visualized. Both notes describe the exploratory laparotomy, the resection of the tumor, and the uneventful postoperative course. The histopathological findings and the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) are also consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the format and structure, with the first note being more narrative and the second note being structured into subjective, objective, assessment, and plan sections."}}
