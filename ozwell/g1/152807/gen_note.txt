**Clinical Note**

**Patient History:**
The patient has a history of irritable bowel syndrome and presented with spontaneous hematochezia. A previous colonoscopy was normal.

**Colonoscopy Findings:**
During the initial colonoscopy, a fungating rectal polyp was found, which did not lift with saline. Biopsy results were consistent with fragments of tubulovillous adenoma and granulation tissue. A follow-up colonoscopy after 2 months revealed a single frond-like, villous, broad-based rectal polyp located within a diverticulum, with an area of distorted mucosal pattern consistent with malignancy. The polyp did not lift with a solution of saline and SPOT. An attempt at Endoscopic mucosal resection was unsuccessful.

**Surgical Evaluation:**
The patient was referred to Colorectal Surgery for a surgical evaluation, and a low anterior resection was recommended. A CT scan performed before the surgery demonstrated a dilated appendix with its tip near the rectum.

**Surgical Findings:**
During surgery, the appendix was found to be densely adherent to the right anterior rectal wall at the area inked during colonoscopy. The distal rectal resection margin was negative for carcinoma. A mass was found at the tip of the appendix with mucin in the lumen, extending proximally but not beyond the distal one half of the appendix.

**Postoperative Course:**
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.

**Pathology:**
Pathology showed adenocarcinoma arising focally within the appendix.
