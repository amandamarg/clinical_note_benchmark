They both describe the case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with a large mass in her left breast, which she noticed about two years ago. Both notes mention the patient's previous benign excisional biopsy around age 50, the increase in size of the current mass, and a single episode of spontaneous bloody discharge from the left nipple. They also describe the physical examination findings, imaging studies, and the suspicion of malignancy. The plan to perform a biopsy and the follow-up instructions are also consistent in both notes. The main difference is in the level of detail and the specific wording used to convey the information."}}
