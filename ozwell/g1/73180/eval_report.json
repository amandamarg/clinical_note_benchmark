They both describe the case of a 53-year-old female with hypothyroidism who presented with sudden-onset chest pain and palpitations. Both notes detail the diagnostic findings, including atrial fibrillation, elevated troponin levels, and the presence of an anomalous left main coronary artery. They also mention the patient's spontaneous conversion to normal sinus rhythm, the normalization of troponin levels, and the attribution of atrial fibrillation to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. The echocardiogram and coronary angiography findings are consistent in both notes, as is the plan for managing the patient's condition."}}
