**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. John  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Referred for seizures and depression.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a history of depressive-apathetic episodes since adolescence and early adulthood, initially treated with benzodiazepines. The first generalized seizure occurred at age 26, accompanied by attention and memory deficits lasting one week. The patient has experienced three additional generalized seizures over the past nine years. Interictal EEGs have shown widespread slow wave activity. Previous therapeutic attempts with carbamazepine and fenobarbital were ineffective. The patient has a personality disorder with cyclic episodes of depression and manic excitation, managed with paroxetine for the past ten years. No seizures have occurred in the past six years, leading to the withdrawal of carbamazepine. In the last year, the patient experienced further episodes of depression and anxiety, with two suicide attempts by poisoning. Following the last attempt, an EEG in the ICU showed widespread slow wave activity, prompting referral to this clinic.

**Mental Status Examination:**  
Cognitive performance is normal, with a score of 30/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Psychological assessment revealed the patient to be logorrheic and anxious, with a history of peculiar events. The patient experiences daily symptoms of seeing their entire body as in a mirror or from an external point of view, not from an elevated visuo-spatial perspective, but in front of them in normal size and color without a definable facial expression. The patient reports difficulty in defining their localization in space, feeling projected out of their body with a dissociation of mind and body for a few seconds.

**Plan:**  
- Prescribe medications to control seizures and depression.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks for further evaluation and management.
