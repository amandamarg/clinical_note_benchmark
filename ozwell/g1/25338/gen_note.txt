**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. Patient No. 4  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mr. Patient No. 4 reports feeling okay today. He has a history of laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy and a tracheostomy several years ago. He also has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes.

**Objective:**
- **Past Medical History:**
  - Laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy
  - Tracheostomy
  - Coronary artery disease
  - Hypertension
  - Uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes

- **Surgical History:**
  - Developed right angle torsion and subluxation of the trachea at the tracheostomy site, leading to a tracheal resection.
  - On POD#3, developed an anastomotic leak requiring return to the operating room for repair of tracheal dehiscence, covered with sternohyoid muscle advancement, and intubation with the cuff past the anastomosis.
  - On POD#6, a repeat bronchoscopy showed an intact anastomotic site, but the patient failed the extubation trial due to supraglottic edema from prolonged intubation, necessitating a tracheostomy.
  - The tracheostomy incision was made vertically, encompassing the airway anastomotic site, and a stomaplasty was performed to protect the innominate artery and support the tracheal anastomosis.
  - Underwent one endoscopic treatment 4 months after the airway resection and was successfully decannulated.

- **Current Status:**
  - Doing well with mild grade 1 stenosis, 5.5 years post-procedure.

**Assessment:**
Mr. Patient No. 4 has a complex medical and surgical history, including a successful decannulation following tracheal resection and subsequent procedures. He currently has mild grade 1 stenosis but is otherwise doing well.

**Plan:**
Continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and manage his chronic conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Follow up as needed to ensure continued stability and address any potential complications.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient mentioned two other cases: one with poorly controlled COPD and tracheal stenting who required a tracheostomy for pulmonary toilet and experienced complete restenosis of the anastomosis, and another 72-year-old male who developed airway stenosis after an emergent slash tracheostomy using a vertical incision.
