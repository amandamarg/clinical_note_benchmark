**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 49-year-old male

**Chief Complaint:**
- Neck pain following accidental injury with a nail gun on a construction site.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports neck pain along the left side and difficulty swallowing after being struck by a nail gun. He has no prior medical history.

**Physical Examination:**
- Neurologically intact with no signs of Horner's syndrome.
- No active bleeding or hemodynamic instability observed.
- The head of the nail is visible behind and above the angle of the mandible.
- The point of the nail is not visible in the oral cavity but is palpable along the oral mucosa on the left side of the oropharynx.

**Emergency Management:**
- The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications at an outlying emergency room and then triaged to the local Level One trauma center for further management.

**Imaging and Findings:**
- CT angiography of the neck showed the nail was very close to the left internal carotid artery near the skull base with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. No active contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm was noted, but evaluation was limited by beam-hardening artifact from the nail.
- Left common carotid angiography demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail.
- 3D rotational angiography showed small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, indicating at least a partial vessel injury.
- Intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout.

**Plan:**
- The case will be discussed among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and neurointerventional surgery to determine the best course of treatment.

**Patient Instructions:**
- The patient was advised to communicate any further questions or concerns.
