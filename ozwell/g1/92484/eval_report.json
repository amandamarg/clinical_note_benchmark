Both notes mention the initial symptoms, the findings from CT scans, the diagnosis of an old calcified cyst in the right kidney, and the recurrence of the abscess due to perforated sigmoid diverticulosis. They also describe the treatment plan, including the drainage of the abscess, sigmoid colectomy, and post-operative care with antibiotics.
