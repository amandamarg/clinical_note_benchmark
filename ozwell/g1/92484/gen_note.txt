**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** [Date of Consultation]  
**Physician:** [Physician's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling unwell for an extended period. Initial symptoms included persistent coughing, sometimes with hemoptysis, and irregular heartbeat. The patient recalls being treated for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. Following admission, the patient developed abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a low-grade fever.

**Objective:**  
Initial CT scan showed consolidation in the right lung base. Subsequent CT scan revealed a small amount of fluid in the abdomen and atypical calcification in the right kidney, leading to a referral to urology. Further imaging identified a large right psoas abscess, which was drained under CT guidance. The patient was diagnosed with an old calcified cyst in the right kidney and discharged to the GP. Eight months later, after a permanent pacemaker was fitted, an interval ultrasound showed no residual psoas abscess. However, one month later, the patient was admitted with a 3-week history of mild back pain, diarrhea, and rigors, along with a discharging abscess in the right lumbar region containing gas. A CT scan revealed sigmoid diverticulosis and a recurrence of the extensive right-sided retroperitoneal abscess.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was diagnosed with perforated sigmoid diverticulosis, which was the cause of the right-sided retroperitoneal abscess.

**Plan:**  
The abscess was initially drained with a 14F pigtail drain as an interim measure while optimizing the patient for surgery. At laparotomy, the sigmoid colon was found to be frozen in the pelvis. A sigmoid colectomy and primary anastomosis were performed. The patient was treated post-operatively with antibiotics and made a slow but uneventful recovery. The patient was discharged fit enough to undergo an open procedure.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will continue to be monitored for any further complications and will follow up with the GP as needed.
