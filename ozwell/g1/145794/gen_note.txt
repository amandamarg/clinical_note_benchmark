- **Complaint:** Problem with upper lip

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a change on the upper lip, initially appearing as a spot the size of a wheat grain. It grew rapidly, becoming red, hard, and painful to touch. The lesion was surgically removed, and the primary histopathological finding was follicular keratosis. A recurrent tumor appeared in the surgical incision area, accompanied by extreme swelling of the upper lip tumorous tissue, measuring less than 2 cm.

**Clinical Observations:**
Upon admission to a tertiary hospital, fungal or bacterial infection of the lesion was excluded. Clinically, a soft, reddish nodular tumor measuring 5 x 2 cm with sebaceous cysts and telangiectasias was observed. Swollen lymph nodes were detected on both sides of the neck, each less than 13 mm in diameter, and a swollen lymph node around 10 mm in size was noted in the right axillary fossa. All biochemical and serological blood tests were within normal reference ranges.

**Diagnosis:**
Following a histopathological audit, the patient was diagnosed with well-differentiated, keratinized, squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lip. The tumorous tissue infiltrated all papillary and reticular dermis, muscle fibers, and perineural spaces.

**Treatment and Outcome:**
The upper lip skin cancer was removed with a second surgical intervention, and the defect was reconstructed. At the time of the second surgical intervention, lymph nodes on both sides of the neck could not be identified either on palpation or by ultrasound examination. The earlier detected lymph node, with almost normal ultrasound characteristics, could not be seen or palpated, negating the need for a lymph node biopsy. Postoperative findings of the lymph nodes showed only transient reactive lymphadenopathy.

**Plan:**
The patient does not require further oncological treatment but will need subsequent medical check-ups of the operated area.
