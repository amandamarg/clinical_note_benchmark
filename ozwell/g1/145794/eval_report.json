They both describe the medical case of a 46-year-old woman who developed a lesion on her upper lip, which was initially diagnosed as follicular keratosis but later identified as well-differentiated, keratinized, squamous cell carcinoma. Both notes detail the progression of the lesion, the clinical observations, the diagnosis, the treatment involving surgical removal and reconstruction, and the outcome, which includes no further oncological treatment but regular check-ups. The information is consistent across both notes, with no significant differences in the details provided."}}
