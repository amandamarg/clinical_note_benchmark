Both notes detail the condition of the right leg as not replantable due to severe damage and the focus on salvaging the left foot through immediate debridement and tissue transfer. They also mention the use of flaps from the amputated limb for reconstruction and the patient's stable general condition. The main difference is in the format and slight variations in wording, but the core information and medical plan are consistent across both notes."}}
