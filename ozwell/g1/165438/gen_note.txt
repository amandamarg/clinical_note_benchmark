**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling unwell following a traumatic incident where he was run over by a train. He states that his right leg was amputated at the level of the knee and he has a crush injury on his left foot.

**Objective:**  
- **Right Leg:** Amputation at the knee level due to severe comminution and bone loss at the knee joint. There was significant skin and soft-tissue loss, with muscle crushed above and below the knee. The limb was deemed not replantable.
- **Left Foot:** Complete degloving injury with all toes crushed and degloved.

**Assessment:**  
The patient's general condition is stable with no other life-threatening injuries. The primary focus is on salvaging the left foot to achieve full healing and weight-bearing capability.

**Plan:**  
- Immediate debridement of the left foot was performed.
- A double free tissue transfer was conducted using skin from the well-preserved amputated right limb. A plantar flap was based on the posterior tibial vessels, and a dorsal flap was based on the dorsalis pedis vessels, maintaining communication through the deep branch of the 1st dorsal metatarsal artery.
- Close monitoring of the patient's progress and follow-up procedures as necessary.

The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in condition or complications. Further procedures will be scheduled as needed to ensure optimal recovery.
