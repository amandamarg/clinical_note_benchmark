- Upper GIS endoscopy revealed a submucosally located mass lesion of dense vascularity at the antrum-corpus junction on the greater gastric curvature.
- Computed tomographic evaluation detected a smooth contoured mass lesion of 52 × 25 × 32 mm containing focal calcifications, located on the greater gastric curvature in the left upper abdominal quadrant.
- Biopsy report indicated insufficient material for a definitive diagnosis; deeper biopsy sampling recommended.
- Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed a smooth contoured mass of 5 × 5 cm projecting from the gastric corpus into the lumen, containing scattered calcifications, with no evidence of malignant transformation.
