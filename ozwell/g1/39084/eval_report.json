Both describe a 25-year-old male patient with a history of intermittent abdominal pain over the last six months, presenting with intractable postprandial abdominal pain and bloody vomiting. They both mention the patient's history of receiving proton pump inhibitor drugs irregularly and note a palpable mass in the epigastric region. The diagnostic tests and findings, including the upper GIS endoscopy, CT scan, PET scan, and intraoperative exploration, are consistent across both notes. The assessment and plan in both notes recommend deeper biopsy sampling for a definitive diagnosis. The main difference is the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's name and the exact time of the note in the clinical note."}}
