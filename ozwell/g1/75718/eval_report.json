They both describe the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian female patient with a swelling in the soft palate, causing breathing and swallowing difficulties. Both notes detail the diagnostic procedures, including initial biopsies that showed normal mucosa and a core needle biopsy (CNB) that revealed a pleomorphic adenoma. They also mention the plan for surgical resection and the need for follow-up with the head and neck service. The main difference is in the format and some specific details, such as the inclusion of the physician's signature and instructions to the patient in the clinical note."}}
