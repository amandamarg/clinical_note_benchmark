They both describe the case of a 64-year-old white female with a large right breast mass present for 2 years. Both notes mention the absence of personal or family history of breast cancer, the patient's past medical history of hysterectomy and oophorectomy, and the fact that she has never been pregnant. The physical examination findings, diagnostic studies, and surgical management details are consistent across both notes. The clinical note provides a concise summary, while the context information offers a more detailed account of the case, including specific measurements and pathological findings."}}
