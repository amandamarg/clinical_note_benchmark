**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Accompanied by:** Patient's Mother  
**Reason for Visit:** Evaluation of lung condition following referral by pediatric cardiologist.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient's mother reports that her son has been experiencing vague upper respiratory symptoms, food regurgitation, and frequent vomiting over the past seven months. There is no difficulty swallowing solid food, but increased drooling has been noted.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
A chest radiograph revealed a round metallic object in the upper esophagus with an irregular contour, causing a mild mass effect on the left aspect of the trachea. A barium swallow indicated that the patient was swallowing without difficulty, and the foreign body was separate from the esophageal tract.

**Procedure:**  
An esophagoscopy was performed in the operating room. The patient was hemodynamically stable with normal oxygen saturation. Lung examination revealed mild crackles over the lung bases, with no stridor or hoarseness. Intraoperatively, the foreign body was not visualized, but a hard mass was palpated at the lateral esophageal wall, covered by granulation tissue. Multiple attempts to remove the foreign body were unsuccessful, leading to the decision to abort the surgery and consider an external approach.

**Post-Procedure Care:**  
The patient has been transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit for close monitoring and necessary care.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring in the pediatric intensive care unit. Consider an external approach for foreign body removal. Keep the patient's family updated on progress and next steps.
