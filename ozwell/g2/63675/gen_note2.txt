**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Smith  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Johnson  

**Subjective:**  
Mrs. Smith presented to the radiology department for a CT-guided biopsy to evaluate a recently diagnosed 1.9 cm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic hyponatremia, congestive heart failure, stroke, and hypertension.

**Objective:**  
During the biopsy procedure, a 19-gauge guiding needle was used to access the lung mass, followed by three 22-gauge Chiba biopsy needles for aspiration and three 20-gauge core biopsy specimens. A volume of hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, but no immediate complications like pneumothorax were observed.

Post-procedure, the patient became unresponsive and experienced cardiopulmonary arrest upon repositioning. A code blue was initiated, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with the administration of epinephrine, resulting in the return of spontaneous circulation. The patient was intubated for mechanical ventilation and admitted to the medical intensive care unit.

A CT chest performed immediately post-resuscitation revealed frothy air dense material in the left atrium and one of the right pulmonary veins, suggesting a broncho venous fistula with air embolism. A concurrent CT head showed no acute intracranial findings. A bedside transthoracic echo with contrast conducted a few hours later was normal, with no evidence of air bubbles in the atria or ventricles, an ejection fraction of 55-60%, and normal right ventricle size and function.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position and underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of air embolism, which she tolerated well. She remained on mechanical ventilation overnight and was successfully weaned off and extubated the following day. Continuous monitoring will be conducted to ensure recovery.
