**Chief Complaint:** Traumatic amputation of the left hand following a fall from a height in the jungle.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient, with no past medical or surgical history, experienced a traumatic amputation of the left hand after falling from a height in the jungle. Post-incident, the patient received an anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin as per WHO protocol due to suspected involvement of wild animals. Additionally, the patient suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was managed conservatively by the neurosurgery department.

**Social History:** The patient comes from a very poor background, relying entirely on daily wages and manual labor to support themselves and their family. The loss of hand functionality has been devastating and depressing for the patient.

**Current Problem:** The primary concern is to stabilize the patient and enable them to reintegrate into society without dependency on others for daily activities and financial needs.

**Plan:** A Krukenberg operation has been planned for the patient. The procedure, though seldom performed and not widely recommended, is deemed the best available option. The classical procedure described by Swanson and Swanson will be followed with modifications. The surgery involves making longitudinal incisions on the flexor and dorsal surfaces of the forearm, separating forearm muscles into two groups, and resecting them to reduce stump size. The pronator teres muscle will be conserved to maintain its integrity as the main operating muscle.

**Patient Education:** The procedure was explained in detail to the patient, including videos and photographs to elaborate on the process. The patient expressed understanding and trust in the medical team.

**Follow-Up:** The surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible. Post-operative follow-up will be necessary to monitor the patient's progress.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:** The patient had no questions or concerns and expressed trust in the doctor.
