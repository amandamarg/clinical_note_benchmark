**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 5:43:34 PM  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented following a traumatic amputation of the left hand due to a fall from a height in the jungle. The patient has no past medical or surgical history. Post-incident, the patient received an anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin as per WHO protocol due to suspected wild animal involvement. The patient also experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was managed conservatively by the neurosurgery department. The patient was advised to get a high-end prosthesis, but it was not affordable. The patient is from a poor background, relying on daily wages and manual labor, and is concerned about the loss of functionality and independence.

**Objective:**  
- Traumatic amputation of the left hand.
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage managed conservatively.

**Assessment:**  
The main issue is to stabilize the patient and enable reintegration into society without dependency on others for daily and financial needs. A Krukenberg operation is planned as the best available option, despite being seldom performed and not widely recommended.

**Plan:**  
- Proceed with the Krukenberg operation, following the classical procedure by Swanson and Swanson with modifications.
- Longitudinal incisions will be made on the flexor and dorsal surfaces of the forearm.
- Forearm muscles will be separated and resected to reduce stump size, conserving the pronator teres muscle.
- Schedule surgery as soon as possible.
- Post-operative follow-up to monitor progress.

**Patient Education:**  
The procedure, including videos and photographs, was explained in detail to the patient. The patient expressed understanding and trust in the medical team.

**Follow-up:**  
Post-surgery follow-up appointments to be scheduled to monitor recovery and adaptation.
