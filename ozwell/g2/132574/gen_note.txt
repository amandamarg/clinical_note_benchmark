**Chief Complaint:**  
Traumatic amputation of the left hand following a fall from a height in the jungle.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient experienced a traumatic amputation of the left hand after falling from a height in the jungle. Post-incident, the patient received an anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin as per WHO protocol due to suspected involvement of wild animals.

The primary concern is to stabilize the patient and enable reintegration into society without dependency on others for daily chores and financial needs.

**Planned Procedure:**  
A Krukenberg operation is planned to address the patient's needs. The procedure, though seldom performed and not widely recommended, is deemed the best available option for the patient.
