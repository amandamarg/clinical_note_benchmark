**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits over the past 6 months, including more frequent stools and passage of mucus. The patient reported no abdominal pain. The patient has a history of bladder exstrophy with multiple surgeries, including a cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5, and recurrent urinary tract infections. There are no other major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy, and no family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
A colonoscopy revealed two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon, each approximately 3 cm in size, with a type IV pit pattern and areas of irregularity. Histological examination confirmed adenomas with low and high-grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion. The mucosa around a diverticulum-like structure was atypical but not adenomatous. Radiological imaging suggested sigmoid thickening, raising the possibility of invasive disease.

**Assessment:**  
The patient underwent a high anterior resection with an open approach due to suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgery. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request. During laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind-ending tube was noted from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon.

**Plan:**  
The patient had an uneventful recovery and reports a good quality of life post-surgery. The decision for a permanent colostomy was patient-driven. The patient was advised to return for any future questions or concerns.

**Follow-up:**  
No immediate follow-up required unless the patient experiences new symptoms or has further questions.
