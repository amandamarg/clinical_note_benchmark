**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports having a regular medical checkup where a small nodule was found in the right lung. The patient denies any medical history or symptoms of concern.

**Objective:**  
- Physical examination: No abnormalities detected.
- Laboratory studies: Results within normal limits or negative.
- Imaging: Initial CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung. The vertebral lesion was separated from the spinal canal.
- Biopsy: Specimens from both lesions showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; diagnosis was inconclusive due to small sample size.
- Follow-up (5 years later): CT scan indicated a slight increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule. MRI revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor. No significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were noted during the clinical course, even with imaging examinations.

**Plan:**  
- Video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion were performed.
- The patient made good postoperative progress and remained free of disease 41 months after the operation.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is in good health, and continued monitoring of the case will be conducted. Further information will be gathered as needed.
