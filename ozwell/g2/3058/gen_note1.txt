The patient reports a recent medical checkup where a small nodule was found in the right lung. The patient denies any medical history or symptoms of concern.

**Objective:**  
- Physical examination: No abnormalities detected.
- Laboratory studies: Results within normal limits or negative.
- Imaging: Initial CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung. The vertebral lesion was separated from the spinal canal.
- Biopsy: Specimens showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance; diagnosis was inconclusive due to small sample size.
- Follow-up: Five years later, CT scan indicated a slight increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule. MRI revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

**Assessment:**  
Suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor. The patient was placed under close observation.

**Plan:**  
- Video-assisted thoracic surgery for the pulmonary lesion.
- Curettage of the lytic bone lesion.
- Postoperative progress was good, and the patient remained free of disease 41 months after the operation.

**Comments:**  
No significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were observed during the clinical course, even with imaging examinations. The patient is in good health and will continue to be monitored.
