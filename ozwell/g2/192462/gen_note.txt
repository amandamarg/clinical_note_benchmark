**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 5:46 PM  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling tired. They have a history of abdominal pain and were previously diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis, for which they underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Despite the surgery, the patient has experienced yearly episodes of pancreatitis over the past three years.

**Objective:**  
A CT scan revealed a dilated pancreatic duct (8 mm) without a discrete mass in the head of the pancreas. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography confirmed the dilated duct with a suspected filling defect in the common bile duct, leading to sphincterotomy and stent placement. Further evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) confirmed the dilated duct with irregular contour and noted free mucin exiting the main papilla and a papillary growth in the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas, consistent with a main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Preoperative lab values, including CA19-9, were normal.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a main duct IPMN, a type of pancreatic cystic tumor. It was unclear if the duct dilatation was due to obstruction from the mass or the IPMN involving the entire duct.

**Plan:**  
The patient was scheduled for a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) with a possible total pancreatectomy if high-grade dysplasia was found. During surgery, high-grade dysplasia cells were identified near the margin, and additional growths were suspected in the duct. Due to the patient's young age and high risk of pancreatic cancer, a completion pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Reconstruction was done in a Roux-en-Y manner. The patient is advised to closely follow up with their healthcare team and attend all scheduled appointments for monitoring.
