**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]
- **Date:** 10/9/2025
- **Presenting Complaint:** Chest pain and dyspnoea

**History:**
- The patient was referred for evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath.
- No pre-existing medical conditions reported.

**Examination:**
- Physical examination revealed feeble femoral pulses.
- Blood pressure measurements showed significant differences between upper and lower limbs: 190mmHg systolic in the upper limb and 75mmHg in the lower limb.
- Ankle brachial index was 0.39.

**Investigations:**
- **Electrocardiogram:** Severe left ventricular hypertrophy.
- **Echocardiography:** Tricuspid aortic valve with significant aortic regurgitation and an aortic root aneurysm (~9 cm). Preserved left ventricular function.
- **CT Angiography:** Aortic root aneurysm (8.8 cm), severe aortic coarctation with subtotal occlusion (lumen <6 mm) distal to the left subclavian artery, evidence of collateral circulation.
- **Coronary Angiography:** Right dominant coronary system, no significant coronary disease.

**Management Plan:**
- Initial plan for a two-staged hybrid approach: endovascular stenting of coarctation followed by surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm.
- Endovascular approach was unsuccessful due to complete obstruction at the aortic isthmus.
- Decision made for a single-stage surgical approach to address both the aortic root aneurysm and coarctation.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Single-stage surgical repair performed.
- Arterial lines placed in left radial and left femoral artery.
- Right infraclavicular and right groin incisions made for peripheral arterial cannulation.
- Aorta repaired using an 8 mm dacron graft.

**Postoperative Status:**
- Patient is in stable condition.
- Close monitoring required for the next few days.
- Follow-up appointments and tests will be necessary.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring and provide supportive care.
- Schedule follow-up appointments to assess recovery and monitor for any complications.
