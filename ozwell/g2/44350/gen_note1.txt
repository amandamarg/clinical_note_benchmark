**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. X  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Y  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- Coronary heart disease  
- Hepatitis B  
- Cirrhosis  
- Hepatic RFA for hepatocellular cancer in segment VIII of the liver (12 months prior to admission)

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted with lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. An abdominal X-ray showed an elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and an air-fluid level in the subphrenic intestine, leading to an initial diagnosis of ileus of unknown cause. Ten days later, the patient developed respiratory failure, shock, acute chest pain, and high fever. A chest X-ray revealed a right pleural effusion and enlarged bowel in the chest cavity. Coronal thoracic CT imaging showed a diaphragmatic defect.

**Interventions and Findings:**  
- Closed drainage of the pleural cavity and antibiotic treatment were administered. Feculent fluid was drained through a chest tube, indicating a diaphragmatic hernia with incarcerated colon perforation and pyothorax.
- An emergency laparotomy revealed a section of necrotic transverse colon with perforation and a large quantity of pus in the pleural cavity, likely due to infarction and perforation following colon herniation into the pleural cavity.
- The herniated colon was returned to the abdomen, revealing a 4 cm diaphragmatic defect abutting the liver. A spot of thermal focal damage was located beneath the defect, at the site of the previous RFA treatment.
- The perforated diaphragm was not adherent to the liver, excluding direct tumor invasion.
- Intestinal necrosis was identified 70 cm from the ileocecal valve, and the proximal small intestine was enlarged.

**Plan:**  
Monitor the patient's condition closely and provide appropriate treatment. Arrange follow-up tests to assess the patient's recovery and response to treatment.
