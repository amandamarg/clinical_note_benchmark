**Chief Complaint:**  
- Follow-up on recent abdominal ultrasound and subsequent procedures.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound due to slightly elevated liver enzymes found during a routine blood test. The ultrasound revealed a 9 cm right adrenal lesion. An abdominal MRI was performed, showing a 10 × 9 cm soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass originating from the right adrenal gland. The patient was asymptomatic with a normal physical exam.

**Endocrinological Evaluation:**  
- Normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function.
- No hypersecretion of catecholamines.

**Adrenal Scan Results:**  
- A well-encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications, without local invasion.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
- Decision made for right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy.
- Surgery performed under general anesthesia with central and arterial lines insertion. Patient positioned in left decubitus.
- Five trocars inserted: 
  - 12-mm port at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle above the umbilicus for the camera.
  - Two 11 mm subcostal ports: one in the midclavicular line, the other at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle.
  - 5-mm subcostal trocar in the anterior axillary line for liver retraction.
  - 5-mm trocar in the epigastrium for aspiration and irrigation.

**Surgical Procedure Details:**  
- Liver retracted, peritoneum incised along the lateral aspect of the IVC to expose it below its intrahepatic course.
- Duodenum mobilized due to mass diversion.
- Dissection carried inferiorly by incising the peritoneum along the lateral edge of the vena cava to the superior edge of the renal vein.
- Careful dissection of the mass, particularly at the medial aspect.

**Follow-up:**  
- No additional concerns or topics discussed during this visit.  
- Patient to return for further follow-up as needed.
