**Time:** 3:01 PM  
**Patient:** [Patient Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports being asymptomatic with a normal physical exam. The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound due to slightly elevated liver enzymes, which revealed a 9 cm right adrenal lesion. An abdominal MRI further characterized the lesion as a 10 × 9 cm soft tissue necrotic encapsulated mass originating from the right adrenal gland. Endocrinological evaluation showed normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and no hypersecretion of catecholamines.

**Objective:**  
An adrenal scan indicated a well-encapsulated 10 × 9 × 7 cm heterogeneous right adrenal mass with areas of necrosis and calcifications, without local invasion.

**Assessment:**  
The decision was made to proceed with a right laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the left decubitus position. Five trocars were inserted: a 12-mm port for the camera, two 11-mm subcostal ports, a 5-mm subcostal trocar for liver retraction, and a 5-mm trocar in the epigastrium for aspiration and irrigation. The peritoneum along the lateral aspect of the IVC was incised, and the duodenum was mobilized. Dissection was carried out along the vena cava to the renal vein, with careful attention to the medial aspect of the mass.

**Plan:**  
Follow-up as needed to monitor recovery and any potential complications post-surgery. Further evaluation and management will be based on the patient's progress and any additional findings.
