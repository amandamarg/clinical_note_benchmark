**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Doctor:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Swelling in the right jaw.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a significant swelling in the right jaw, leading to facial asymmetry. The swelling developed three months ago following an infection and was initially treated with antibiotics, which were ineffective. The patient has no past or congenital diseases noted in their medical history.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- Severe swelling in the right jaw without fluctuation upon palpation.
- Submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region.
- Normal skin color and appearance.

**Oral Examination:**  
- Right mandibular first molar tooth with a deep caries cavity, non-mobile.

**Radiographic Examination:**  
- Deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.
- Lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible and at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, indicating focal new bone formation.

**Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Findings:**  
- Tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone on the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, originating from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.
- Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center at the lower edge of the mandible and the vestibule surface in this region.

**Diagnosis:**  
Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Treatment Plan:**  
Endodontic treatment was initially considered to retain the infected tooth. However, due to the patient's remote rural location and the prohibitive cost of treatment, the patient was referred to the surgical clinic for dental extraction as the most appropriate treatment method.
