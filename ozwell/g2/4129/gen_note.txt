**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Chief Complaint:** Worsening chronic hypertension

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents for evaluation of worsening chronic hypertension. The patient has been on hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan for 10 years. Recently, the patient's systolic blood pressure has been exceeding 200 mmHg, leading to an emergency department visit for headache and malaise. The patient was treated and discharged but returned 5 days later with difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in the lower extremities. On presentation, the blood pressure was 216/81 mmHg. Despite medical therapy, including five antihypertensive agents and an esmolol infusion, the blood pressure remained refractory.

**Workup and Findings:**  
- No acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis was found.
- Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction.
- Renal artery ultrasound indicated renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left.
- Vascular surgery consultation revealed weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit. Ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred, and an angiogram was scheduled.
- Aortography showed widely patent renal arteries but significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta, with stenosis greater than 90% and a pressure gradient exceeding 100 mmHg between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements.
- CTA confirmed stenosis 1.3 cm proximal to the celiac origin measuring 5 mm.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be consulted with other specialists to develop a comprehensive management plan. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as needed.
