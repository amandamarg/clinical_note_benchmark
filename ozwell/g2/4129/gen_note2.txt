**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Chief Complaint:** Worsening chronic hypertension

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a history of chronic hypertension, previously managed with hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan for 10 years. Recently, the patient's systolic blood pressure has exceeded 200 mmHg, leading to an emergency department visit for headache and malaise. Despite treatment and discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department 5 days later with difficulty finding words, blurred vision, and tingling in the lower extremities. Blood pressure on presentation was 216/81 mmHg. 

**Workup and Findings:**  
- No acute intracranial process or carotid stenosis was identified.
- Echocardiography showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction.
- Blood pressure remained refractory despite treatment with five antihypertensive agents and esmolol infusion.
- Renal artery ultrasound indicated renal artery stenosis with flow at the arterial origin measuring 350 cm/s on the right and 208 cm/s on the left.
- No history of kidney disease or elevated creatinine levels.

**Consultations and Procedures:**  
- Vascular surgery consultation revealed weak but palpable femoral pulses and an audible abdominal aortic bruit. Ankle-brachial index measurements were deferred, and an angiogram was scheduled.
- Aortography performed the following day showed widely patent renal arteries but significant stenosis at the distal thoracic aorta extending into the abdominal aorta.
- The degree of stenosis was greater than 90%, with a pressure gradient between the upper extremity and intra-aortic measurements exceeding 100 mmHg.
- CTA confirmed a stenosis 1.3 cm proximal to the celiac origin measuring 5 mm.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be consulted with other specialists to develop a comprehensive management plan. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the patient's condition and response to treatment.
