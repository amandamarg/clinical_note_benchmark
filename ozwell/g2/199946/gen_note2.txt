**Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain and vomiting.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, focally tender in the right lower quadrant, and vomiting. Initial blood tests showed an elevated white cell count of 12.9 × 10^9/L, a neutrophil count of 10.4 × 10^9/L, and a C-reactive protein level of 34 mg/L. An abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple calculi within the gallbladder, but the gallbladder wall thickness was not assessed. A non-contrast CT scan, due to impaired renal function, showed abnormal dilatation of the proximal small bowel with a possible transition point in the left iliac fossa and pneumobilia, possibly indicating previous sphincterotomy.

**Assessment:** The CT scan findings suggested a bowel obstruction with a transition point in the left iliac fossa. There was no evidence of appendicitis or another inflammatory process in the right iliac fossa. Further testing with a small bowel follow-through revealed no history of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography or cholecystectomy. An addendum to the CT report indicated a gallstone ileus from a choledochoduodenal fistula, with a non-calcified gallstone possibly present at the transition point in the left iliac fossa.

**Plan:** The patient will undergo a laparotomy to remove the gallstone obstructing the small bowel. Post-surgery, the patient will stay in the hospital for a few days to recover, and a histological diagnosis will be confirmed. The procedure is scheduled for tomorrow. The patient's family will be updated on the condition and treatment plan.

**Patient Understanding:** The patient understands the diagnosis and the need for surgical intervention. No further questions or concerns were expressed.
