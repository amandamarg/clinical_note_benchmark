**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Time:** 5:47 PM  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Presenting Complaint:** Abdominal pain and vomiting

**History:**
- The patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, focally tender in the right lower quadrant, and vomiting.
- Blood tests showed elevated white cell count (12.9 × 10^9/L), elevated neutrophil count (10.4 × 10^9/L), and C-reactive protein level at 34 mg/L.

**Investigations:**
- Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple calculi within the gallbladder; gallbladder wall thickness was not assessed.
- Non-contrast CT scan (due to impaired renal function) showed abnormal dilatation of the proximal small bowel with a possible transition point in the left iliac fossa and pneumobilia, possibly indicating previous sphincterotomy.
- Small bowel follow-through indicated no history of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography or cholecystectomy.
- CT report addendum suggested gallstone ileus from a choledochoduodenal fistula with a non-calcified gallstone at the transition point in the left iliac fossa.

**Assessment:**
- The findings are indicative of a bowel obstruction due to gallstone ileus.

**Plan:**
- Proceed with conservative management initially.
- Plan for a laparotomy to remove the obstructing gallstone.
- Post-operative hospital stay for recovery and confirmation of diagnosis with histological analysis.

**Discussion:**
- The patient was informed about the need for a laparotomy, which involves an incision in the abdomen to access and remove the gallstone.
- The patient understood the procedure and post-operative care, including a hospital stay for a few days.
- The patient requested that their family be updated on their condition.

**Next Steps:**
- Laparotomy scheduled for tomorrow.
- Update the patient's family as requested.
