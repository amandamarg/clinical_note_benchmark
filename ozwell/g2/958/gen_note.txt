**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Doctor:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with pain in the upper left canine, which has been ongoing for a few weeks and occurs during chewing or biting. The patient has a history of dental decay and fractured teeth.

**Objective:**  
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism.  
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.  
- Previous composite fillings in upper front teeth and implant restorations in posterior superior quadrants.  
- New and secondary subgingival caries in six front teeth with poor conservative prognosis due to subgingival depth and extent of decay.

**Assessment:**  
The patient previously decided to replace residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge. The treatment was carried out in stages, including extraction of lateral incisors, placement of immediate implants, and preparation of residual teeth as abutments for a temporary bridge. Subsequently, the remaining teeth were extracted, and the provisional bridge was replaced by a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.

**Plan:**  
- The two implants have osseointegrated well.  
- Schedule an appointment next week for the placement of a permanent bridge.  
- Advise the patient to maintain good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups.  

**Follow-up:**  
Appointment scheduled for next week for permanent bridge placement.
