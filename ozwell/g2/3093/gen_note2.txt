**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Susan  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
Mrs. Susan reports persistent, widespread pain, with severe pain localized in her hands and legs. She has a history of carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand, which provided only temporary relief. Previous treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, have been ineffective or exacerbated her pain. She experiences weakness in her legs, leading to falls, and has difficulty with bladder and bowel control.

**Objective:**  
Mrs. Susan underwent an MRI and emergency surgery in May 2011 to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression, resulting in paralysis on the right side post-surgery. A subsequent surgery in August 2012 for pain relief worsened her condition. She currently receives weekly injections for pain relief, which provide marginal benefit, and takes high doses of medication for nerve pain with limited effect. She reports heightened sensitivity in her legs, where even light touch causes pain.

**Assessment:**  
Mrs. Susan's symptoms suggest possible ongoing spinal cord issues or nerve damage. Further investigation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of her pain and neurological symptoms.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule imaging tests, including an MRI, to assess for spinal cord compression or other abnormalities.
- Conduct nerve tests to evaluate potential nerve damage.
- Follow-up appointment to discuss test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.  

**Follow-up:**  
Mrs. Susan will be contacted to schedule the necessary tests and a follow-up appointment to review the results.
