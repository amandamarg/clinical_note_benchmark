**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Susan  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
Mrs. Susan reports persistent, widespread pain, with severe pain in her hands and legs. She has a history of carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand, which provided only temporary relief. Previous treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, have been ineffective or exacerbated her pain. She experiences weakness in her legs, leading to falls, and has difficulty with bladder and bowel control.

**Objective:**  
Mrs. Susan underwent an MRI and emergency cervical spine surgery in May 2011 to relieve spinal cord compression, resulting in right-side paralysis post-surgery. A subsequent surgery in August 2012 for pain relief worsened her condition. She receives weekly pain relief injections with marginal benefit and takes high doses of nerve pain medication with limited effect. She has heightened sensitivity in her legs, where even light touch causes pain.

**Assessment:**  
Chronic pain with a history of cervical spine issues and nerve involvement. Previous surgeries and treatments have not provided significant relief. The patient exhibits symptoms of nerve damage and heightened sensitivity.

**Plan:**  
- Conduct imaging tests, including an MRI, to assess for spinal cord compression or other issues.
- Perform nerve tests to evaluate potential nerve damage.
- Schedule follow-up appointment to discuss test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.  

**Follow-up:**  
Mrs. Susan will be contacted to schedule the necessary tests and a follow-up appointment to review the results.
