**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Sarah  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Sarah was transferred from a nearby general hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She reported sudden onset left iliac fossa pain that woke her from sleep four hours prior. Her last menstrual period was approximately eight weeks ago, and she has not experienced any vaginal bleeding.

**Objective:**
- Haemoglobin level dropped from 132 g/L to 108 g/L.
- Transabdominal ultrasound showed approximately one litre of free fluid in the abdomen.
- Laparoscopy findings: One litre of blood was drained from the abdomen. No sign of ectopic pregnancy was found. The uterus was of normal size, and the fallopian tubes were unremarkable. A small active bleeding source was identified on the right ovary, controlled with limited diathermy. No obvious cyst was present.

**Assessment:**
- Presumptive diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy not confirmed.
- Active bleeding source on the right ovary controlled.
- Increased b-HCG level to 38 IU/L noted.

**Plan:**
- Monitor b-HCG levels and schedule a follow-up in a few days.
- Patient advised to return if any symptoms occur.
- No hysteroscopy or handling of the endometrium was performed during the laparoscopy.

**Follow-Up:**
Sarah was discharged two days post-operation and returned for a follow-up, reporting that she feels fine. Further monitoring of b-HCG levels is planned.
