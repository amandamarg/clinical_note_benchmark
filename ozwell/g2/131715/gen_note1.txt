**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  
**Follow-up Appointment:** Post-transplant surgery follow-up

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension, well-controlled with amiloride.

**Transplant Details:**  
- The patient underwent a kidney transplant. The kidney used was a right kidney from a 69-year-old female donor who had brain death due to a large intracerebral hemorrhage. The right kidney had normal anatomy and was successfully transplanted.

**Discussion Points:**  
- The left kidney from the same donor was not used for transplantation due to the presence of a 1.5 cm saccular aneurysm near the hilum, with aneurysmal vessels at the branch point of the renal artery. Surgical reconstruction was deemed impossible.
- Histopathology of the excised aneurysmal segment revealed cystic medial degeneration, characterized by marked thinning of the arterial wall, fragmentation, and loss of elastic fibers, with increased mucopolysaccharide matrix material.
- The etiology of the aneurysms is unclear but may be related to arterial fibrodysplasia, exaggerated at branch points in the renal vasculature.
- The risk of rupture is low but carries a high mortality rate.

**Plan:**  
- The patient is advised to monitor their health and report any unusual symptoms.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few months to monitor the patient's post-transplant progress.

**Notes:**  
- The aim is to raise awareness of this uncommon condition among retrieval and transplant teams, especially in cadaveric and non-heartbeating kidneys, where it can often be overlooked.
