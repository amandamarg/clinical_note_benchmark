**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  
**Follow-up Appointment:**

**Reason for Visit:** Follow-up after transplant surgery.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension, well controlled with amiloride.

**Transplant Details:**  
- The patient was informed about the kidney used for the transplant. The kidney was a left cadaveric kidney from a 69-year-old female donor who had brain death due to a large intracerebral hemorrhage.
- A 1.5 cm saccular, thin-walled aneurysm was found near the hilum of the kidney, located at the branch point of the renal artery into multiple small branches, all of which were aneurysmal.
- The kidney was not used for transplantation due to the surgical impossibility of reconstructing the aneurysmal vessels.
- The aneurysmal segment was excised for research purposes, and histopathology revealed cystic medial degeneration with marked thinning of the arterial wall, fragmentation, and loss of elastic fibers, and increased mucopolysaccharide matrix material.
- The right kidney from the same donor had normal anatomy and was successfully transplanted in another unit.

**Discussion:**  
- The etiology of the aneurysms is unclear but appears related to arterial fibrodysplasia, exaggerated at branch points in the renal vasculature.
- The risk of rupture is low but carries a high mortality rate.
- Awareness of this condition is important for retrieval and transplant teams, especially in cadaveric and non-heartbeating kidneys.

**Follow-up Plan:**  
- The patient was advised to monitor their health and report any unusual symptoms.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few months.

**Patient Understanding:**  
- The patient acknowledged understanding the information provided and the importance of monitoring their health.

**Next Steps:**  
- Schedule follow-up appointment.  
- Continue current hypertension management with amiloride.
