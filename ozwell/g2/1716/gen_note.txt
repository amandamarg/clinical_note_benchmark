**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Subject:** Follow-up on Intractable Pain Management

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with intractable right arm pain and swelling, ongoing for the past 10 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to the clinic for management of intractable pain associated with a diagnosis of primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. The patient initially presented to the emergency department, where a CT scan of the neck with contrast revealed two masses in the right axillary and supraclavicular regions. The patient has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which were complicated by thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a non-surgical candidate.

The patient's pain is described as constant, 10/10 in intensity, located in the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain is dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature, worsened by passive and active range of motion. At its best, the pain is 7/10 with oral medications. The patient also reports progressive weakness of the entire right upper extremity.

**Imaging and Diagnostic Studies:**  
- MRI of the brachial plexus revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords, as well as the right brachial artery.
- A diagnostic brachial plexus block was performed in the hospital due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. The brachial plexus could not be visualized using ultrasonography due to tumor effects in the classic supraclavicular area.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be examined, and medical records will be reviewed. Additional tests and treatments will be recommended to help manage the patient's pain. The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss results and next steps.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is scheduled to return in one week for further evaluation and management planning.
