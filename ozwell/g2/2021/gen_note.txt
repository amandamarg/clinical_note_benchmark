**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/9/2025  
**Time:** 3:05 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Bilateral axillary masses and numbness in the right hand.  
- **Medical History:** Hypertension for 4 years; no history of trauma.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Palpable pulsatile masses in both axillae:  
  - Right axilla: 12 cm  
  - Left axilla: 8 cm  

**Ultrasound Examination:**  
- Right axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 12-cm segment, measuring 67 × 45 mm with a 27-mm thick thrombus.  
- Left axillary artery: Aneurysm in a 9-cm segment, measuring 40 × 43 mm with a 17-mm thick thrombus.  

**Doppler Ultrasonic Examination:**  
- Thrombus surrounding the lumen with turbulent, pulsatile flow in the center.  
- Aneurysmal segment continuous with the brachial artery.  

**CT Angiography:**  
- Giant fusiform aneurysms:  
  - Right axillary artery: 140 × 77 mm  
  - Left axillary artery: 93 × 45 mm  
- Thrombi present in both aneurysms, allowing flow in the lumen.  
- Extension to the brachial artery and contour irregularities at the distal end of the right-side aneurysm, suggesting a spontaneously healed rupture.  

**Additional Findings:**  
- No signs of collagen tissue disease detected in the eyes, bones, skin, or joints through physical or laboratory examinations.  

**Plan:**  
- Due to the patient's symptoms and high risk of aneurysm rupture, endovascular closure was initially considered. However, appropriate size stents were unavailable for the large and tortuous aneurysms.  
- Follow-up appointment scheduled in one week for further evaluation and management.  

**Instructions:**  
- Patient advised to return in a week for a check-up.
