**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** 2-month history of right shoulder and upper abdominal pain.

**Medical History:**
- **Initial Diagnosis:** Gallbladder tumor detected via ultrasonography at another hospital.
- **Referral:** Referred to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- **Laboratory Findings:** Nearly normal at presentation.
- **Imaging Results:** CT and MRI revealed a mass at the cervix of the gallbladder involving the common and right hepatic arteries, with enlargement of the No. 12 lymph node.

- **Immunohistochemical Analysis:** Positive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 7; negative for cytokeratin 20.
- **Diagnosis:** Unresectable gallbladder cancer.

**Treatment Course:**
- **Initial Treatment:** Gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/mÂ² on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle.
- **Response to Treatment:** After 13 cycles, marked decrease in tumor size noted on CT, rated as partial response per RECIST criteria, version 1.0. After 15 cycles, tumor disappeared; complete response (CR) confirmed by CT after 20 cycles.
- **Surgical Evaluation:** Reevaluation for surgical resection post-CR; patient deemed unsuitable for surgery due to severe bronchial asthma.
- **Continued Treatment:** Gemcitabine monotherapy continued. After 27 cycles (12 months post-CR), patient and family opted to continue therapy to prevent relapse.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring the patient's condition and provide updates. Discuss any questions or concerns with the patient as needed.
