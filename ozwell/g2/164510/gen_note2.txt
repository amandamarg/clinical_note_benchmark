**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/8/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Subject:** Follow-up on Gallbladder Cancer Treatment

**Medical History:**  
The patient has a 2-month history of right shoulder and upper abdominal pain. Initial ultrasonography at another hospital detected a gallbladder tumor, leading to a referral to our facility for further diagnosis and treatment.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Laboratory Findings:** Nearly normal at presentation.
- **Imaging:** CT and MRI revealed a mass at the cervix of the gallbladder involving the common and right hepatic arteries, with enlargement of the No. 12 lymph node.
- **Biopsy:** Percutaneous biopsy indicated adenocarcinoma.
- **Immunohistochemical Analysis:** Positive for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 7; negative for cytokeratin 20.

**Diagnosis:**  
Unresectable gallbladder cancer.

**Treatment Course:**  
- Initiated on gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/mÂ², administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle.
- After 13 cycles, CT showed a marked decrease in tumor size, rated as partial response per RECIST criteria, version 1.0.
- After 15 cycles, the tumor disappeared, with complete response (CR) confirmed by CT after 20 cycles.
- Surgical resection was deemed unsuitable due to the patient's severe bronchial asthma.
- Gemcitabine monotherapy was continued.

**Current Status:**  
After 27 cycles (12 months post-CR), a discussion was held regarding the continuation of gemcitabine therapy. The patient opted to continue treatment due to concerns about potential tumor relapse.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and provide updates. The patient is advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
