**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents for follow-up after bilateral total hip replacement surgery. The patient has a history of osteoarthritis in both hips and chronic Hepatitis C virus infection. No other medical conditions were reported. The patient was admitted for surgery and arrived in a wheelchair. The patient was allowed to decide which hip would be performed first.

**Objective:**  
- New radiographs were taken before the surgery. Other causes of rapid destruction of the hip joint were ruled out, and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral Rapidly Destructive Osteoarthritis (RDO).  
- Samples for microbiology and histology were taken during the procedures due to a possible septic etiology, despite no history of septicemia and elevated inflammatory markers attributed to chronic hepatitis.  
- The right hip was performed through an anterior approach with 2 g of cefazolin as antibiotic prophylaxis. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted with no complications. The femoral head destruction led to an important defect in the posterior and superior wall of the acetabulum.  
- Four days after the first procedure, one out of six cultures was positive for Enterococcus faecium with no local and systemic signs of infection or pain. The synovial biopsy revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no signs of acute inflammation. Urine cultures were negative. The patient did not receive antibiotic treatment as the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria were not met.  
- The left hip was performed through a posterior approach with a cemented stem. The acetabulum was also affected by bone destruction, but the cup was placed at a correct height. This resulted in a leg length discrepancy that is well tolerated by the patient, considering her previous functional status.  
- Five days after the second procedure, the patient had a post-operative period without complications.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is recovering well from bilateral total hip replacement surgery. The procedures were completed successfully with no significant complications. The patient is tolerating the leg length discrepancy well.

**Plan:**  
- Instruct the patient on follow-up requirements.  
- Monitor for any signs of infection or complications.  
- Address any questions or concerns the patient may have during follow-up visits.
