**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay but is experiencing chronic back pain. The patient has a history of depression and a previous suicide attempt. The patient disclosed that the attempt involved an overdose of diazepam and methadone following an argument with her husband. She estimated taking approximately 40 to 50 tablets of 5 mg diazepam but was unsure of the methadone dosage.

**Objective:**  
The patient was found unresponsive the day after the overdose with a respiratory rate of 4 breaths per minute. She was revived with naloxone and required a naloxone drip infusion over 24 hours. Flumazenil was not used during treatment. Initial lab results showed elevated potassium at 7.6, which later normalized. The patient also had leukocytosis secondary to mild aspiration pneumonia, treated with antibiotics. She was discharged within one week in an improved state to a psychiatric facility. After two days of in-patient psychiatric care, she was discharged home in a markedly improved state, with mental status back to baseline and fully self-sufficient without cognitive deficits.

**Family and Social History:**  
Family and friends confirmed the patient was cognitively normal until three weeks post-event when she suddenly became confused and forgetful, with rapid worsening the following day. She exhibited social withdrawal, lack of personal hygiene, incontinence, lethargy, and was not very interactive.

**Assessment:**  
After five days without improvement, the patient was evaluated at the Emergency Department. A CT head exam disclosed marked and diffuse hypointensity throughout the subcortical white matter. An MRI showed confluent changes throughout the entire white matter, appearing diffusely hyperintense on both FLAIR and T2 weighted sequences, with hyper-intensity also noted on diffusion-weighted imaging. The cerebellar involvement was noted as an unusual feature.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to continue with follow-up psychiatric care and monitoring. A referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and treatment is recommended.
