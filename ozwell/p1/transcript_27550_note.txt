**Chief Complaint:**  
Neck discomfort with a local bulge on the right side of the neck.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with neck discomfort and reports a local bulge on the right side of the neck. Upon physical examination, a large lump was observed on the right lobe of the thyroid gland.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Admitted to the hospital in June 2007 for painless hematuria and diagnosed with right renal carcinoma.
- Underwent radical resection of the right renal carcinoma. Postoperative pathological examination showed moderately differentiated right ccRCC (stage III).
- No further treatment was received post-operation.
- Annual re-examinations of the kidneys through ultrasound showed no abnormal echo in the right renal fossa.

**Thyroid History:**  
- July 2012: Ultrasound examination revealed multiple thyroid nodules, with the largest nodule measuring 1.2 × 0.6 cm in the right lobe, clear boundary, and homogenous echo. The patient was asymptomatic and refused treatment.
- March 2015: Color ultrasound examination showed the largest nodule in the right lobe was 2.5 × 1.3 cm, with a heterogeneous echo and small patchy fluid sonolucent area. CDFI showed circular blood flow signals around the nodule and poor blood flow signals inside the nodule. Re-examination by ultrasound was suggested due to previous medical history.
- September 2018: Ultrasound examination indicated an evident increase in the volume of the right thyroid lobe, with an abnormal shape. The thickness of the right lobe was 4.6 cm. Multiple hypoechoic nodules were detected, with the largest nodule measuring 5.6 × 3.7 cm.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The patient is advised to undergo a biopsy to determine the nature of the thyroid nodules.
- An appointment will be scheduled with a specialist for further evaluation and management.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be contacted to schedule the biopsy and specialist appointment. Further treatment will be determined based on biopsy results.
