**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and numbness in the right arm.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and numbness in the right arm for approximately 2 months, with symptoms worsening and numbness spreading. The patient has also noticed a rapidly growing mass on the upper part of the right arm.

**Physical Examination:**  
A large palpable mass, approximately 13 Ã— 12 cm, is located on the proximal humerus of the right arm.

**Radiographic Examination:**  
The mass is over 10 cm in diameter with massive cortical erosion and extension into soft tissues. The surface of the tumor is indistinct.

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on radiologic findings and histology from a needle biopsy, the patient is diagnosed with grade II chondrosarcoma.

**Past Medical History:**  
- 20-year history of a painless and palpable bony mass at the same location.
- At age 16, the patient sought treatment for a distal radius fracture. Plain radiographs at that time showed multiple cartilaginous dysplasia or multiple enchondromatosis (Ollier's disease) in the humerus and lower part of the radius of the right arm.
- No signs of hemangiomas in the soft tissue.
- No family history of skeletal disorders or other significant medical history.

**Treatment Plan:**  
A limb-salvage strategy has been designed, involving the resection of the tumor and prosthetic replacement of the proximal humerus. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the operation. During surgery, the tumor will be excised with maximum possible surgical safety margins, and a frozen section biopsy will be conducted to ensure a safe surgical margin. A humeral head prosthesis from Waldemar Link GmbH & Co. will be applied in the same session following tumor resection.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will need to attend regular follow-up appointments post-operation.

**Plan:**  
Schedule the operation as soon as possible. Obtain informed consent prior to the procedure.
