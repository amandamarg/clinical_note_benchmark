**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Date:** 10/1/2025
- **Department:** Ophthalmology

**Chief Complaint:**
- Palpable mass at the left medial canthal region.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient was referred by their primary doctor due to a palpable mass at the left medial canthal region.
- Symptoms include tearing for six months and occasional bloody discharge from the left eye for two months.
- Swelling at the left medial canthal region is present, but it is not painful or affecting vision.

**Past Medical History:**
- No history of regional surgery or trauma.
- No history of excessive sun exposure.
- No history of cutaneous primary melanoma.

**Physical Examination:**
- Cystic, localized, non-tender palpable mass at the left medial canthus consistent with an enlargement of the lacrimal sac.

**Imaging:**
- Computed tomography scanning of the paranasal sinus showed a soft tissue mass in the left lacrimal sac, attached to the medial orbital wall.
- No orbital cavity involvement or bony destruction detected.
- No infiltration of the surrounding soft tissue.
- Mass did not extend into the nasolacrimal duct.
- No associated cervical lymphadenopathy.

**Procedure:**
- Dacryocystectomy performed.
- During the procedure, a brown-pigmented soft tissue containing cystic mass filled the lacrimal sac and did not protrude through the nasolacrimal duct.
- The mass was removed from the nasal and lacrimal bone and dissected from the medial canthal tendon.

**Pathology:**
- Biopsy and histological examination of the surgical specimen showed solid growth of malignant cells characterized by production of melanin pigments and hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli.
- Tumor cells showed strong immunoreactivity to melanoma specific antibody, HBM-45.
- Immunoreactivity to the S 100 protein was negative.
- Diagnosis: Malignant melanoma.
- Resection margins were not free of tumor.

**Plan:**
- Perform a complete metastatic workup including computed tomography scanning of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check for lymphadenopathy or other evidence of metastasis.

**Follow-up:**
- Schedule the complete metastatic workup.
- Discuss further treatment options based on the results of the metastatic workup.
