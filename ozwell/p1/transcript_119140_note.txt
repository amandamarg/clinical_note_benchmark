**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:05:08 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing morning stiffness and pain on the medial side of the right knee after walking, along with difficulties in achieving full flexion of the knee. The patient has been undergoing conservative treatment for osteoarthritis with steroid infiltration mixed with lidocaine, which has been helping with the pain, though difficulties with walking persist. Additionally, the patient reports bilateral painless swollen calf muscles, which were first noticed a few years ago. There is no pain at night, fever, or other medical illnesses. The patient's past medical history is uneventful.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed swelling of the soleus muscle on both sides. On the right leg, the swelling is localized over the whole soleus muscle, measuring approximately 10 by 3 cm. On the left lower leg, the swelling is about 3 by 3 cm over the medial part of the soleus muscle. Dimpling is noted in both legs while standing, more pronounced on the right. Full strength is present in all lower leg muscles, and reflexes are normal. The overlying skin appears normal without deformities, erythema, or warmth, and arterial pulsations are intact. Laboratory test results show no abnormalities. X-ray results do not indicate any bony irregularities in the tibia. MRI of the legs reveals bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle.

**Assessment:**  
1. Osteoarthritis of the right knee with morning stiffness and pain.
2. Bilateral intramuscular venous malformations of the soleus muscle, asymptomatic.

**Plan:**  
- Continue conservative management for osteoarthritis with steroid infiltration mixed with lidocaine.
- Due to the asymptomatic nature of the venous malformations and potential muscle damage from resection, conservative management is advised. No angiogram or ultrasonography will be performed at this time.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the findings and the decision for conservative management. The patient understands the plan and agrees with the follow-up schedule.

**Follow-up:**  
In three months.
