**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Painful swelling on the right middle finger.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient presented with a painful swelling on the right middle finger, approximately 2 cm in size and irregular in shape. The nail bed was noted to be brown in color. The swelling has been present for about 30 years, initially starting after a fracture on the finger. The patient reported an increase in size over the past 6 months. No axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy was noted, and the patient reported feeling fit and well otherwise.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- Tests revealed a lesion causing severe erosion of the distal interphalangeal bone. Initial suspicion of aggressive adenocarcinoma was not supported by test results. A plain chest radiograph showed no sign of pulmonary metastasis.

**Treatment and Surgical Intervention:**
- An amputation of the middle phalanx of the right middle finger was performed to provide a definite diagnosis and maintain finger function, allowing for primary closure. Histopathology of the specimen showed a high mitotic grade lesion, diagnostic of ADPA, with a small focus of lymphovascular invasion. The tumor was 0.7 mm from the nearest resection margin.

**Prognosis and Follow-up:**
- The patient was informed of the high rates of recurrence and metastasis associated with the condition. Despite this, the patient declined further surgical treatment. 

**Subsequent Developments:**
- 17 months post-initial presentation, the patient developed a mass in the right axilla. Tests confirmed multiple pulmonary metastases. An axillary clearance was performed, with one of the ten nodes confirming metastatic disease. The patient subsequently suffered an intracranial hemorrhage into the right internal capsule. Over the past 2 years, the patient has remained only mildly short of breath due to pulmonary metastasis.
