**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. S  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Physician:** [Insert Physician's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:** Follow-up after IVF and pregnancy management.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mrs. S underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) for tubal factor infertility in January 2007. She had a positive beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on January 20, 2007, and an early ultrasound revealed a twin pregnancy. One sac was located low towards the cervical canal, and the other was towards the fundus, corresponding to 6 weeks of gestation. The early ultrasound suggested the possibility of a low implantation but did not confirm heterotopic pregnancy.

Mrs. S was hospitalized following an episode of bleeding per vaginum and was managed conservatively, being discharged after 3 days. A repeat ultrasound at 7 weeks and 5 days of gestation confirmed the diagnosis of intrauterine and cervical heterotopic pregnancy. She was readmitted on February 19, 2007, and underwent fetal reduction of the cervical pregnancy under general anesthesia by injecting intrathoracic potassium chloride under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. Post-procedure, the cardiac activity of the intrauterine fetus was normal, and she was discharged after 2 days.

The remainder of the pregnancy was uneventful, except for mild vaginal spotting intermittently. At 28 weeks of gestation, Mrs. S was readmitted with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Doppler study on ultrasound showed reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows. She was monitored with biweekly ultrasound for fetal Doppler blood flow studies.

At 31 weeks of gestation, a lower segment cesarean section was performed due to absent end diastolic umbilical arterial fetal blood flow and reduced amniotic fluid index (amniotic fluid index 5). A male baby weighing 1.16 kg was born on July 26, 2007.

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
The lower uterine segment showed the presence of trophoblastic tissue, and hemostatic sutures were required due to active bleeding from the anterior wall near the isthmus. The lower segment was ballooned up.

**Postoperative Findings:**  
Post-operative ultrasonography showed the presence of small amounts of trophoblastic tissue with low vascularity.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring and follow-up as needed. Further management will be based on the patient's recovery and any additional findings.
