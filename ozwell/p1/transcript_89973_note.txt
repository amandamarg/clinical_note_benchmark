**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**  
Mrs. X presented for a follow-up after her mammography screening. She was recalled due to findings of three separate lesions in her right breast and one in her left breast.

**Objective:**  
- Clinical examination revealed two masses in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast and one in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The overlying skin was normal, and there were no palpable regional lymph nodes.
- Mammography of the left breast showed a 15-mm lesion in the upper outer quadrant. Core biopsy confirmed it as a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma, both oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive.
- Right breast findings included a 13-mm area of micro calcification in the upper outer quadrant at the 10 o'clock position, confirmed as a grade I invasive ductal carcinoma, also both oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive. The second mass at the 11 o'clock position and the third in the lower inner quadrant showed lymphoma-like features on core biopsy but not breast carcinoma.
- Supplementary report was inconclusive, leading to a recommendation for diagnostic excision biopsy.
- Staging CT of the chest and abdomen was normal.

**Assessment:**  
- Left breast: Grade I invasive ductal carcinoma, oestrogen and progesterone receptor positive.
- Right breast: Grade I invasive ductal carcinoma with intermediate grade ductal carcinoma, and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma involving the lymph nodes of both axillae.

**Plan:**  
Discussed treatment options with Mrs. X and her family. She opted for a right mastectomy and axillary node clearance, and wide local excision with axillary node sampling on the left, considering it easier than a combination of therapeutic local excision and diagnostic needle localisation of the other masses in the right breast. Regular follow-ups and check-ups are advised.

**Follow-up:**  
Mrs. X will need to return for regular check-ups and follow-up treatments. She was advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
