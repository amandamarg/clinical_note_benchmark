**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  
**Clinic:** Neurology Clinic  

**Subjective:**  
The patient, with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, presented to the neurology clinic with progressive, bilateral, lower extremity numbness that began in the feet. The patient reports that the numbness worsens with prolonged standing or walking. Additionally, the patient has experienced lower back pain.

**Objective:**  
An MRI of the thoracic cord demonstrated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. Initial workup was negative for an etiology, leading to a suspicion of neurosarcoidosis. A lumbar puncture was performed and returned negative. Spinal imaging suggested dilatation of the spinal epidural venous plexus, indicating a possible dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF).

**Assessment/Plan:**  
A catheter angiogram was conducted for further evaluation. Imaging of the left and right subclavian arteries was performed to assess spinal cord blood flow. The left vertebral artery was found to originate from the aortic arch, with complete filling of all segments upon injection. Retrograde filling of the left subclavian artery suggested a dual origin from the left subclavian artery. A catheter placed within the left subclavian revealed a second origin of the left vertebral artery, merging with the aortic V1 segment at the C5 vertebrae level. Equal filling was observed from both the aortic and subclavian origins, with no aneurysms or dissections noted.

Injection of the right T7 spinal artery revealed a dAVF originating from a distal branch of the spinal artery, combining with an anterior spinal vein with abnormal filling. The remaining spinal arteries were examined and found to be grossly normal, without aneurysms, fistulas, or other vascular abnormalities.

The patient will require follow-up appointments to monitor the condition and ensure stability. Further management will be based on the progression and any changes in the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.
