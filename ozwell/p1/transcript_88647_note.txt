**Interventions:**  
The patient underwent neurosurgical drainage of the lesion and was admitted to the obstetrical intensive care unit for postoperative care and ventilatory support.

**Progression:**  
The patient's neurological status deteriorated progressively, leading to a non-reactive coma with no sign of brainstem activity. Maternal brain death was confirmed by a transcranial Doppler scan of the cerebral arteries.
