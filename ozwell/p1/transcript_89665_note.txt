**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports experiencing severe lower back pain for the past few weeks, which began during coitus and radiates down the right leg. The pain has increased in severity and is accompanied by claudication-type pain in the right leg after walking approximately 100 meters. The patient was previously referred to a neurosurgeon for an urgent opinion due to a suspected disc prolapse. An MRI scan showed no evidence of spinal cord pathology, suggesting a musculoskeletal origin. However, the pain has not resolved after 6 weeks, prompting the patient to return for further evaluation.
