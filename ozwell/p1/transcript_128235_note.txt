**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]
- **Date of Visit:** [Date of Visit]
- **Referred for:** Intracytoplasmic sperm injection
- **Reason for Referral:** Primary infertility due to husband's asthenozoospermia and teratospermia
- **Duration of Infertility:** 6 years

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient underwent oocyte retrieval 3 days prior to the visit. Post-procedure, she experienced pain in the right lower quadrant and right flank, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Her temperature and blood pressure remained normal.

**Physical Examination:**
- **Abdominal Examination:** Normal bowel sounds, moderate right lower quadrant tenderness, and voluntary guarding.
- **Vaginal Examination:** Tender mass of 10 cm at the right iliac fossa with rebound tenderness.

**Investigations:**
- **Ultrasound Scan:** Indicated hyperstimulation with enlarged ovaries and excessive fluid in the pelvic area.
- **Doppler Imaging:** Showed diminished right ovarian vascular flow compared with the left ovary.

**Diagnosis:**
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) with right ovarian torsion.

**Treatment and Surgical Intervention:**
An emergency operation was performed immediately. During laparoscopy, approximately 500 ml of clear ascitic fluid was noted. The right ovary measured 9 × 6 × 5 cm, appeared dark blue, and the pedicle was twisted 360 degrees. After untwisting the right pedicle, there was an improvement in color within 5 minutes. Continued observation showed the right ovary and fallopian tube returned to a similar color as the left ovary 30 minutes later.

**Follow-Up:**
An ultrasound scan conducted 9 days post-operation showed the right ovary was 63 × 48 mm in size with good blood flow signals. The patient was subsequently discharged.

**Outcome:**
A frozen-thawed embryo transfer was performed on 3 April 2017, and a pregnancy test 12 days later was positive. The patient is currently asymptomatic and in her 7th month of pregnancy.
