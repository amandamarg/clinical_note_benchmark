**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Bulge in right groin

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a bulge in the right groin, which has been present for approximately 6 weeks. Initially, the bulge was painful, but it has since become asymptomatic. The patient is unsure of the cause.

**Past Medical History:**
- Hernia repair in 1977, with no recollection of mesh implantation.

**Physical Examination:**
- A 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpated in the right groin, lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Studies:**
- Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix inside the sac.
- Laboratory test showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 10^9/L.

**Assessment:**
- Right inguinal hernia with appendix involvement.

**Plan:**
- Surgical intervention to repair the hernia.

**Surgical Procedure:**
- A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.
- The hernia consisted of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance.
- Attempts to reduce the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity were unsuccessful due to adhesions.
- A relaxing incision was made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum was entered.

**Postoperative Plan:**
- The surgery was successful. The patient will be monitored closely for the next few days.
- The patient may experience some discomfort or pain, which should subside in a few days.
