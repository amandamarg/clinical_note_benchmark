**Chief Complaint:**  
Fever, tachycardia, and swelling of the right hand following intravenous injection of mercury.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted on 15th February 2005 after self-administering an intravenous injection of mercury as an aphrodisiac. The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and swelling of the right hand. Upon admission, the patient was haemodynamically stable. An incision and drainage attempt was made in the emergency room due to a diagnosis of an injection abscess. An X-ray revealed a radio-opaque shadow overlying the fourth metacarpal, third and fourth intermetacarpal space, extending over the carpus and the wrist joint up to about 1 cm over the distal end of the radius and ulna dorsal to the skeleton. A diagnosis of extravasation of injected mercury was made. The patient underwent thorough debridement under general anesthesia, and a large amount of mercury was physically removed from the dorsum of the hand. Some mercury was removed along with excision of the surrounding soft tissue, confirmed by radiography. The wound was left open to allow any remaining mercury to exit. The patient discharged themselves the next day against medical advice.

The patient returned on 7th March 2005 after another subcutaneous injection of elemental mercury over the precordium. An attempt to drain an abscess was made at another hospital, but the patient refused further surgical procedures despite radiographic evidence of mercury deposition in the subcutaneous plane of the chest wall.

In October 2005, the patient presented with swelling over the precordium with surrounding inflammation. This time, the patient consented to surgery, and the mercury was removed along with surrounding tissue en masse. The wound healed uneventfully.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Mercury poisoning due to self-injection.
- Successful surgical removal of mercury from the hand and precordium.
- Monitor for any long-term effects of mercury exposure.
- Educate the patient on the dangers of self-administering substances and the importance of following medical advice.
