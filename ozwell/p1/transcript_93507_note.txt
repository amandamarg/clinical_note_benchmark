**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:42:53 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Lump on the right side of the neck noticed six weeks ago, gradually increasing in size.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a lump on the right side of the neck, first noticed six weeks ago. The lump has been gradually increasing in size. The patient reports no systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss. Appetite is good, and weight has been stable.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Polycystic ovaries  

**Physical Examination:**  
- A nontender, firm to hard lump on the right side of the neck, approximately 4 × 4 cm in size.  
- Full ENT examination including flexible nasolaryngoscopy performed. No other lymphadenopathy found.  
- Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examination were unremarkable.  

**Laboratory and Imaging Results:**  
- Routine laboratory tests and thyroid function tests were normal except for a raised ESR of 40 mm/hr.  
- Ultrasound examination of the neck revealed a 35 × 18 mm cystic mass in the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe with internal echoes.  
- Ultrasound guided FNA of the mass revealed 10 cc of frank pus, raising clinical suspicion of TB. Subsequent culture was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis.  
- Ultrasonogram revealed abnormal lymph nodes in the right level 2 area of the neck.  
- Mantoux test was 34 mm.  
- Chest X-ray was normal.  

**Treatment and Follow-up:**  
The patient was referred to chest physicians and started on standard quadruple therapy for tuberculosis. Approximately 12 months post-treatment, the patient responded well to treatment. The neck swelling has disappeared, and the patient is euthyroid. A repeat ultrasound showed complete resolution of the neck mass and lymph nodes.  

**Discussion:**  
Tuberculosis of the thyroid gland is extremely rare, with its true incidence unknown. The rarity is attributed to factors such as the bactericidal property of colloid material and high thyroid blood flow. Tuberculosis of the thyroid gland may be primary or associated with tuberculous infection of other organs. Proper treatment can lead to complete recovery.  

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's recovery and address any further concerns or questions.
