**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient presented with a right groin bulge that developed 6 weeks ago. Initially, the patient experienced sharp pain, but has been asymptomatic since then.

**Physical Examination:**
- A 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpated in the right groin, just lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Studies:**
- A computed tomography scan was performed, revealing a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.
- Preoperative laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 10^9/L.

**Assessment:**
- Right inguinal hernia with appendix involvement.

**Plan:**
- Surgical intervention was recommended and agreed upon by the patient.

**Procedure:**
- A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.
- The hernia was found to consist of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance.
- The base of the appendix was seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity.
- A relaxing incision was made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum was entered to facilitate reduction.

**Intraoperative Findings:**
- Chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented the reduction of the appendix.

**Complications:**
- No complications occurred during the procedure.

**Postoperative Plan:**
- The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks post-surgery.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to monitor the recovery process and ensure proper healing.

**Family Discussion:**
- The cause of the hernia is unknown, with no implantation of mesh during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977.
- The family was informed about the procedure and postoperative care requirements.
