**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:18:57 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a complaint of a lump in the left side of the abdomen, accompanied by a dull aching pain persisting for the past 5 months. The patient also reported occasional vomiting. The lump has been gradually enlarging over the same period.

**Objective:**  
- **Ultrasonography:** Revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass occupying the whole abdomen and pelvis.  
- **CT Scan:** Showed a homogenous non-enhancing retroperitoneal mass measuring approximately 17 × 21 cm with a mixed echogenic pattern in its anterolateral region. The mass displaced the pancreas and left ureter anteriorly and across the midline. A focus of calcification was seen at the periphery of the lesion. The left kidney and its pelvicalyceal system were not visualized. There was a loss of fat planes with the adjacent gut loops.  
- **Exploratory Laparotomy:** A large cystic mass with solid areas weighing around 7 kg was found in the left side of the abdomen, adherent to the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure, and the descending colon. The tumor was resected en mass along with the adherent large bowel, and a primary colo-colic anastomosis was performed.  

**Assessment:**  
The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was followed up for six months without recurrence. The specimen grossly revealed a 29 × 20 × 15 cm mass with marked congestion and a multinodular external surface. The cut section revealed a multicystic mass with solid areas. A segment of large intestine measuring 5 cm was attached to it, and no kidney was identified grossly. Microsections showed a biphasic (epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation) malignant tumor with solid and cystic components infiltrating through the wall of the adherent bowel. The resection margins were free from the tumor. One of the sections showed a small amount of residual renal tissue.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up appointments to ensure continued monitoring and to confirm the absence of recurrence.
