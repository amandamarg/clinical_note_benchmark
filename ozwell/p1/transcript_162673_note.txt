**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They have a history of bladder exstrophy repair 17 years ago, which resulted in dehiscence and continuous urine leakage. An ileal conduit urinary diversion was performed six months later to address the leakage. Six months prior to today's presentation, the patient noticed a rapidly increasing irregular mass arising from the exposed bladder mucosa.

**Objective:**  
Examination revealed a hemispherical growth with an irregular surface in the region of the exposed bladder mucosa. A computed tomography scan showed a mildly enhancing nodular lesion on the right side of the lower abdomen, superficially confined to the urinary bladder. A biopsy was performed, and results were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. Routine hematological evaluation, liver function tests, and chest radiograph were normal.

**Assessment:**  
The patient underwent a radical cystectomy, which included removal of the urinary bladder, a cuff of the surrounding abdominal wall, and pelvic lymph node dissection. Post-resection, there was an 8 cm x 9 cm full-thickness defect of the lower abdomen. The peritoneum was mobilized and sutured in the midline, and both recti were also mobilized and sutured in the midline. The skin defect was resurfaced with an extended groin flap from the left side, and the secondary defect was covered by a split-thickness skin graft. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen indicated well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the underlying muscle, stage pT2a, with dense lymphocytic infiltration of the stroma. All resected margins and the deeper plane of resection were free of tumor.

**Plan:**  
In the postoperative period, the patient developed a small collection beneath the flap, which was drained by removing two stitches. Daily dressings were performed, and the site granulated well, healing without significant additional scarring. The patient is advised to attend follow-up appointments and check-ups to ensure ongoing health and address any concerns.  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return for regular follow-up appointments to monitor their condition and ensure no recurrence or complications arise.
