**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Reason for Visit:** Follow-up after transplant surgery.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension, well controlled with amiloride.

**Surgical History:**  
- Recent transplant surgery.

**Transplant Details:**  
- The patient was informed about the kidney used for the transplant. It was a left cadaveric kidney from a 69-year-old female donor who had brain death due to a large intracerebral haemorrhage.
- A 1.5 cm, saccular, thin-walled aneurysm was found close to the hilum of the kidney, located at the branch point of the renal artery into multiple small branches, all of which were aneurysmal.
- The kidney was not used for transplantation due to the surgical impossibility of reconstructing the aneurysmal vessels.
- With consent for research purposes, the aneurysmal segment was excised and sent for histopathology, revealing marked thinning of the arterial wall with widespread fragmentation and loss of elastic fibres in the tunica media, with increased amounts of mucopolysaccharide matrix material, indicating cystic medial degeneration.
- The right kidney from the same donor had normal anatomy and was successfully transplanted in another unit.

**Discussion:**  
- The aetiology of the aneurysms is unclear but appears related to arterial fibrodysplasia, exaggerated at branch points in the renal vasculature.
- The risk of rupture is low but carries a mortality rate of up to 80%.
- There are case reports of laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair of simple renal artery aneurysms in live related transplants.
- The aim is to raise awareness of this uncommon condition among retrieval and transplant teams, especially in cadaveric and non-heartbeating kidneys, where it can often be overlooked.

**Plan:**  
- The patient is advised to monitor their health and report any unusual symptoms.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few months.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
- The patient acknowledged understanding of the information provided and agreed to the follow-up plan.
