**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right heart failure from an invasive mediastinal mass with near complete occlusion of pulmonary arteries.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has a history of spinocerebellar ataxia and presented with right heart failure due to an invasive mediastinal mass. The patient reported bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion, which began in February 2017. Prior to this, the patient was in their usual state of health. 

In February 2017, the patient visited the emergency department where an amorphous, invasive superior left mediastinal mass was discovered, involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery. A PET scan showed marked fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the anterior mediastinal mass. Initial biopsy pathology revealed only thrombus material and a minute fragment of unremarkable intima. The patient was unable to tolerate a scheduled cardiac MRI for repeat biopsy planning and was lost to follow-up.

In May 2017, after a progressive decline, the patient visited the thoracic surgery clinic. An echocardiogram showed a severely dilated right atrium and severely dilated right ventricle with the interatrial septum bowing to the left, suggestive of right heart failure. A bronchoscopy was performed, but the pathology was nondiagnostic, notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. A third biopsy was also nondiagnostic despite seemingly adequate yield, notable only for vessel wall fragments with myxoid degeneration and few small crushed.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment. The patient is instructed to monitor symptoms and return if they worsen.

**Instructions to Patient:**
