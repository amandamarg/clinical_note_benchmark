**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing headaches for a few years, with an increase in severity. The headaches began following issues with the right jaw during chewing, leading to persistent jaw tension. The patient describes the headaches as low-intensity, occurring almost daily, primarily in the morning, and exacerbated by stress. The headaches impact the patient's enjoyment of activities with family and friends. The patient uses analgesics but not excessively.

**Objective:**  
A Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) was conducted, revealing that continuous jaw contraction might be contributing to the headaches. This behavior appears to be nearly constant, including during sleep, suggesting it has become automatic.

**Assessment:**  
The patient's headaches are likely related to chronic jaw tension. The hypothesis is that reducing daytime jaw tension will also alleviate nighttime tension, potentially reducing headache frequency and severity.

**Plan:**  
The treatment plan includes eight visits with home exercises between sessions, plus two follow-up visits. The goal is to reduce headache frequency to no more than twice a week. The patient is motivated to change behavior and will be instructed on specific exercises to achieve this goal.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will return for the next scheduled appointment.  

**Patient Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient did not have any questions at this time.
