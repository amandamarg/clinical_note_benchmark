**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:02:55 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Age:** 82  
- **Gender:** Female  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Wound dehiscence on the left knee with hardware exposure.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a painful wound on the left knee with hardware exposure. The patient reports that the wound has been bothering her for a while. She denies any other medical issues or comorbidities.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Total left hip arthroplasty performed eight years ago due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities.
- Revision total hip arthroplasty performed due to progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation. X-ray revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation).
- Early symptoms of infection occurred three weeks post-revision surgery, including high fever, suppuration, no wound healing, and laboratory abnormalities. Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful.
- Replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages was planned. In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed.

**Current Assessment:**  
The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Initial attempts to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap were unsuccessful due to the highly scarred surrounding area and atrophic gastrocnemius muscle. No other local flaps were large enough to cover the defect, necessitating the use of a free flap. However, a lack of receptor vessels was noted, and the descending genicular artery was dissected but found to be of small caliber with calcified plaques in the lumen, rendering it unsuitable.

**Family Concerns:**  
The patient's family expressed concern about her condition and were informed about the current situation and treatment plan.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the wound and evaluate further options for wound coverage.
- Discuss potential alternative surgical interventions with the surgical team.
- Provide support and information to the patient and her family regarding her condition and treatment options.
