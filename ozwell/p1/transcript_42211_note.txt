**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Abdominal pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with abdominal pain that has been worsening over time. The patient has a history of similar pain episodes. In 2006, the patient was diagnosed with appendicitis, which was confirmed by a CT scan showing extensive inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant with a possible interloop abscess. The patient underwent an appendectomy, which resolved the symptoms. In 2011, the patient presented with right flank pain and urinary symptoms, and a CT scan revealed a right ureterovesicular junction calculus with mild right ureteral dilation. The patient was managed medically and advised to follow up with a urologist. Three weeks ago, the patient experienced severe abdominal pain and induration of the lower abdominal wall. CT imaging showed an enlargement of a complex cystic mass inseparable from the anterior superior wall of the urinary bladder and abutting the posterior margin of the abdominal wall. The radiographic diagnosis was an urachal remnant abscess versus tumor. The patient was started on antibiotics and had a surgical consultation, leading to a scheduled cystoscopy and surgical exploration.

**Surgical Findings and Outcome:**  
Cystoscopy did not demonstrate any abnormalities of the bladder. During the exploratory laparotomy, an indurated mass and abscess were encountered near the area of the anterior abdominal wall and bladder. The abscess was drained, and a few small calcifications were removed for pathologic examination. A complete exploration was performed, and the phlegmon appeared to be limited to the dome of the bladder, which was excised.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has a history of abdominal pain with previous episodes related to appendicitis and ureterovesicular junction calculus. The recent episode involved a complex cystic mass with a diagnosis of urachal remnant abscess versus tumor. The surgical intervention included drainage of the abscess and excision of the affected area. Further follow-up and monitoring are necessary to assess recovery and any potential complications.
