**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Lump in the left breast

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a lump in the left breast, first noticed approximately two years ago. The patient reports that the lump has increased in size over time. There was a single episode of spontaneous bloody discharge from the left nipple, but no associated pain or other discharge. The patient has not had any prior breast evaluations, although she had a benign excisional biopsy of a breast lump around age 50. The patient sought care due to the size of the mass reaching a point that prompted assessment.

**Family History:**
- No family history of breast or ovarian cancer.

**Physical Examination:**
- A large left breast mass measuring 20 cm was found, involving the inferior and medial left breast. The overlying skin is bluish-purple in color, with lateral deviation and distortion of the nipple. The patient reports discomfort related to the fullness of the mass.

**Imaging Studies:**
- **Mammography:** Revealed a large mass in the left breast with a few scattered coarse calcifications.
- **Ultrasound:** Demonstrated a complex vascular mass with a large homogenous fluid component occupying the majority of the left breast, suspicious of malignancy.
- **MRI:** Showed a 13 × 11 × 13 cm mass with both cystic and enhancing solid components abutting the chest wall, with skin involvement on the lateral aspect. A small palpable mass on the left upper anterior chest is consistent with a lipoma.

**Assessment:**
The imaging features are suggestive of malignancy.

**Plan:**
- Arrange for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
- Follow-up appointment to discuss biopsy results once available. 

**Patient Instructions:**
- The patient was advised to return for a follow-up visit after the biopsy results are available.
