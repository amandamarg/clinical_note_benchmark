Marked papillomatosis with hypergranulomatosis between the papillae and lack of granules at the papillary surfaces. Immunohistochemical testing positive for HPV L1 capsid protein.  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The patient was placed on a course of antibiotics due to concerns for an abscess.  
- A wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex was planned for removal of the growth.
