**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports increasing knee pain and functional impairment. The knee pain has been worsening over time, and the patient experiences difficulty with activities such as walking and climbing stairs. The patient has a history of treatment in 1991 for a giant cell tumor of the right distal medial femoral condyle with curettage and allograft bone grafting, followed by a local recurrence in the same year, which was treated with repeat curettage and cementation of the lesion with polymethylmethacrylate. The patient remained symptom-free for 20 years until the current presentation.

**Objective:**  
- Physical examination reveals a longitudinal anteromedial knee scar with a 10-degree varus deformity.  
- Range of motion is from 15° to 90° of flexion.  
- Plain knee radiographs show a large bolus of cement occupying the medial femoral condyle, extending superiorly into the metadiaphyseal junction, with significant joint space narrowing. No evidence of loosening of the cement or tumor recurrence is noted.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient is a candidate for a total knee replacement. Different reconstruction options were considered, including a modular oncologic prosthesis and allograft prosthetic composite. However, due to the good quality of the cement bed, a standard total knee replacement was planned, with a modular tumor prosthesis available as a backup option. The patient agreed to this plan.

**Surgical Findings and Procedure:**  
During surgery, severe articular cartilage wear was noted, especially in the medial compartment, but the cement had not worn completely through into the joint. The femoral medullary canal was opened using a combination of a drill and burr to accommodate a standard intramedullary guide rod. The distal femoral cut was performed using a standard saw, cutting through the cement without difficulty. The remainder of the femoral cuts were completed after appropriate sizing of the distal femur. The cement remained well interdigitated to the host bone throughout the femoral preparation with no evidence of loosening or fragmentation. A cruciate retaining femoral component was selected to avoid further cutting into the cement for the box of a posterior stabilized femoral component. The proximal tibia was prepared using standard techniques, and the patella was resurfaced.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up in a few weeks to monitor progress and ensure proper healing. The patient was informed to reach out with any questions or concerns in the future. No questions were posed by the patient at this time.
