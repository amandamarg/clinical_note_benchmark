**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Vomiting after medication intake  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing vomiting after taking medication, which began on March 9th, 2015. The patient was taking six different drugs at that time, all of which were related to vomiting according to the database.  

**Objective:**  
The decision tree model identified Tramadol HCI as the most highly ranked drug related to the patient's vomiting. The system displayed information on the frequency and severity of the symptom, which was used to make a recommendation.  

**Assessment:**  
The physician accepted the system's recommendation and changed the patient's prescription to Tramadol HCI. A few days later, the physician reported that the causality between the patient's vomiting and Tramadol HCI was probable or likely, at 50%.  

**Plan:**  
The result was stored and used later for patients with similar symptoms and demographics. The decision tree indicated that the medical department was the most important factor in identifying causative drugs for adverse events. Due to a limited dataset, there were only two patients in the same group as the patient. The highlighted rule showed why Tramadol HCI was recommended as the most likely cause of the adverse event.  

**Follow-up:**  
The physician will review the patient's file to determine if any changes are needed going forward.
