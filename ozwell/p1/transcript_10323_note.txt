**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. [Patient's Last Name]

**Date:** [Date of Visit]

**Subjective:**
The patient presented to the hospital after experiencing a fall down 13 stairs at home while under the influence of alcohol. She reports a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and degenerative lumbar spinal disease. The patient is a lifelong smoker and remains independent in her daily activities. Initially, she experienced neck pain and stiffness but denied any chest pain.

**Objective:**
Upon initial presentation, the patient was hemodynamically stable. A CT scan revealed no obvious vertebral fractures but identified a focal pseudoaneurysm along the left lateral wall of the aortic arch, measuring 19 mm in maximum anteroposterior dimension, located between the origins of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. The vascular surgical team recommended conservative management with yearly CT scans.

Eleven months later, the patient returned with sudden onset chest pain radiating to her back. Initial observations were unremarkable. A repeat CT scan showed the aneurysm with no significant size increase. The vascular surgical team determined that an endovascular approach was unsuitable due to the lesion's proximity to the head and neck vessels. Transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiography were normal.

**Assessment:**
The patient underwent surgery via a median sternotomy. The aortic arch and head and neck vessels were dissected, and the pseudoaneurysm was identified on the left lateral aspect of the arch. Following full heparinization, cardiopulmonary bypass was established by cannulation of the ascending aorta and the right atrium at a temperature of 35Â°C. The base of the aneurysm was approximated using several 3/0 prolene pledgeted mattress sutures. A needle was inserted into the excluded part of the aneurysm to ensure no persistent flow. The bypass time was 27 minutes.

**Plan:**
The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable. She was extubated on the same day and subsequently discharged. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in a few months to monitor her progress.
