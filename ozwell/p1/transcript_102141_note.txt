**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:38:16 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Medical History:** Migraine with aura, Type-2 diabetes  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Trouble with speech and movement on the left side of the body  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency room with difficulty speaking clearly and weakness on the left side of the face, arm, and leg.  

**Assessment:**  
Based on the symptoms of dysarthria, facial weakness, and hemiparesis, a stroke was suspected. An MRI confirmed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, specifically an infarction in the anterior third of the right MCA territory due to occlusion of the superior M2 branch of the right MCA.  

**Plan:**  
The patient has been referred to King Fahad Hospital of the University for emergent endovascular therapy. An angiogram was performed using a 5-F femoral sheath and a diagnostic catheter under local anesthesia. The left ICA injection was normal, while the right ICA injection confirmed the occlusion of the superior M2 branch. The left vertebral injection showed normal flow, and the right vertebral artery was accessed at its origin with a slow injection of contrast administered to determine the best course of treatment.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Close monitoring of the patient's condition  
- Adherence to diabetes management plan  
- Compliance with prescribed medications  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to follow up with any questions or concerns.
