**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:20:03 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Acute pain in the right knee, suspected dislocation.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department after experiencing acute pain in the right knee while dancing the quick-step, an energetic and form-intensive style. The incident occurred last night when the patient rotated about a planted right foot, resulting in acute pain and lateral shifting of the patella. On arrival, the patient's right leg was locked in full extension with severe pain.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- No history of previous knee trauma or dislocations.  
- No joint hypermobility.  
- No past medical history suggesting a cause for patellar dislocation.  
- No pediatric lower limb alignment problems.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Deformity of the right patella indicative of a rare patellar dislocation.  
- Patella rotated on its vertical axis with skin tenting over the knee joint, fixed in position.  
- Mild joint effusion, no joint line tenderness.  
- Significantly reduced range of motion at the right knee; any flexion from full extension causes significant pain.  
- Able to perform straight leg raise, indicating intact extensor mechanism.  
- Limb otherwise neurovascularly intact.  
- Examination of the contralateral limb is normal.  

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- AP radiograph: Laterally dislocated patella.  
- Lateral radiograph: Abnormal appearance with rotated patella impacted in the intercondylar notch of the femur.  

**Procedures:**  
- One unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction under procedural sedation with propofol and fentanyl.  
- Successful reduction under general anesthesia with a muscle relaxant. The patella was relocated using a closed technique, with the articular surface facing anterior laterally, wedged in the intercondylar notch, and impacted into the lateral femoral condyle.  

**Plan:**  
- Rest the knee for a few days.  
- Take prescribed pain medication.  
- Follow-up appointment in one week for a checkup.
