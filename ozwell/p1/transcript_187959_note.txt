**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:19:11 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Fractured central incisors, high risk for caries, eccentric bruxism, partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant, multiple decay and fractured teeth.

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with fractured central incisors but reported no pain or discomfort besides the fracture. The patient acknowledged experiencing teeth grinding at night.

**Objective:**  
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism noted.
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.
- Multiple decay and fractured teeth observed.

**Assessment:**  
The fractured teeth are likely contributed to by the patient's bruxism. The conservative approach will be taken to maintain the upper front teeth using composite fillings. Restoration of the posterior superior quadrants with implants is necessary.

**Plan:**  
1. Proceed with composite fillings for the upper front teeth.
2. Restore posterior superior quadrants with implants.

**Follow-up:**  
Three years later, in 2017, the patient returned with pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. Due to the poor conservative prognosis from the subgingival depth and extent of decay, the patient opted for a new implant-supported bridge, similar to the posterior prostheses.

**Treatment:**  
- Staged approach: Extracted lateral incisors and placed two immediate implants.
- Prepared four residual teeth as abutments for a temporary bridge to maintain aesthetics and function during osseointegration.
- Extracted the four remaining teeth using SST.
- Replaced initial provisional bridge with a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants.
- Only one out of four abutment teeth required root canal treatment due to a periapical infection.

**Outcome:**  
Unfortunately, the patient eventually passed away. Further assistance to the family is offered during this time.
