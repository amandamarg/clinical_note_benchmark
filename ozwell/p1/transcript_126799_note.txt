**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]

**Encounter Type:** Follow-up

**Subjective:**
The patient reports being symptom-free and experiencing remarkable improvement post-surgery. They are a school teacher and use the prosthesis for approximately 70 hours per week. The patient can stand for 5 hours at a stretch without any pain, and their pain-free walking distance has increased from half a mile preoperatively to two miles post-operatively. The patient has no current concerns.

**Objective:**
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient was involved in a road traffic accident five years ago, resulting in a below-knee amputation. The stump healed with secondary intention due to insufficient soft tissue cover and infection. The patient was initially fitted with a prosthesis, but experienced repeated breakdown and sensitivity in the loading area of the stump, making it painful and difficult to bear weight.
- **Surgical History:** Reconstruction of the stump was performed using an anterolateral thigh flap from the opposite side. The scar tissue was excised completely to the bone, and a 14 Ã— 14 cm flap along with vastus lateralis muscle was harvested. The patient was positioned supine for flap harvest and then prone for recipient vessel dissection in the popliteal fossa. Anastomosis was performed end-to-end to popliteal vessels with minimal vessel diameter discrepancy. The operation lasted six hours.
- **Postoperative Course:** The postoperative period was uneventful, and the skin grafted donor site healed satisfactorily. The patient was discharged on the 16th postoperative day and refitted with the prosthesis 10 weeks after surgery. At 20 months post-surgery, the flap shows no atrophy or redundancy.

**Assessment:**
The patient has made a significant recovery following stump reconstruction and refitting with a prosthesis. They report no pain and have increased mobility and endurance.

**Plan:**
- Continue current prosthesis use and monitor for any changes in symptoms or function.
- Schedule follow-up in a few months to reassess the patient's condition and prosthesis fit.
