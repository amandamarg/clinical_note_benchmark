**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:42:41 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Inability to walk or bear weight on the left leg.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with an inability to walk or bear weight on the left leg following a running incident on uneven ground, resulting in a knee dislocation. The patient has a history of a similar episode 10 months ago, where the patella was dislocated and manually reduced by the patient's mother. At that time, radiographic images showed a reduced patella with no fracture. The patient wore a full-length leg cast for 1 month and resumed daily activities without difficulty. There is a family history of recurrent patellar dislocation, with the patient's father affected.  

**Examination:**  
- Anterior knee pain with positive apprehension sign, indicating lateral patellar instability.  
- Swollen knee with obvious deformity on the lateral aspect.  
- Tenting of the skin and soft tissue by the underlying patella without contusion or bruise.  
- Knee locked in 15 degrees of flexion, with inability to perform movements at the knee joint.  

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- Standard anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs show a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis, with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter.  
- No evidence of associated fracture or signs of osteochondral damage.  

**General Examination:**  
- No hyperlaxity of the joints.  
- No clinical signs of genu valgum, patella alta, tibial torsion, or trochlear dysplasia.  
- Quadriceps angle on the normal limb is within normal range.  

**Treatment Plan:**  
A closed reduction under conscious sedation was attempted but was unsuccessful. The decision has been made to proceed with an open reduction. The patient will be shifted to the operating room, where a midline vertical incision will be made along the knee joint.
