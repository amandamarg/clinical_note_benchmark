**Patient History:**  
The patient was admitted to our institution in June 2002 for the treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk. A giant ICA aneurysm was previously identified during an evaluation for abducens nerve palsy on the right side in November 2001. At that time, a tortuous basilar artery was noted without aneurysmal dilatation. The patient underwent endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm, involving the petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA, at another hospital. However, the patient developed a severe headache seven months post-treatment.

**Admission Details:**  
Upon admission, the patient reported progressive dyspnea and a dull headache in the occipital area. Neurologic examination revealed a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in all four extremities. MR imaging showed a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery compressing the brain stem. Cerebral angiography revealed a fusiform giant aneurysm with an irregular contour involving the basilar trunk. The left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm, and a de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA.

**Treatment Plan:**  
To alleviate brain stem compression, the decision was made to obliterate the basilar trunk aneurysm despite associated risks. Prior to endovascular embolization of the aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft. This was necessary because occlusion of the basilar trunk would have compromised the blood supply to the posterior circulation, leaving the left ICA as the sole vessel responsible for perfusion of the entire brain post-occlusion, given the prior occlusion of the right ICA. The bypass supplied the right middle cerebral artery territory, and adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA).

**Surgical Details:**  
During surgery, part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned.

**Plan:**  
Review the patient's file and develop a follow-up plan.
