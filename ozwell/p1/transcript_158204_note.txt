**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]

**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with issues related to breathing, including a cough and sputum tinged with blood for the past 4 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was diagnosed with central non-small cell lung cancer 12 months ago. Initial imaging showed a completely obstructed bronchus by a tumor with postobstructive pneumonia. The CT scan at that time revealed thickening of the wall of the right main bronchus and significant narrowing of the lumen due to tumor infiltrations. Metastatic lymphadenopathy was noted in the right lower paratracheal and subcarinal area.

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient was hospitalized and underwent bronchoscopy 9 days after the initial CT scan. The bronchoscopic examination demonstrated near-complete obstruction of the right main bronchus by an endoluminal mass with diffuse bleeding. External beam radiotherapy was administered to control bleeding from the friable endobronchial tumor, which gradually decreased over several days. However, 11 days post-radiation therapy, the patient developed sudden dyspnea. Chest radiography indicated total collapse of the right lung, and subsequent bronchoscopy revealed complete obstruction of the right main bronchus with diffuse bleeding.

**Treatment:**  
Bronchial artery embolization was not considered due to the absence of active arterial bleeding and lack of prominent contrast enhancement of the mass on CT. A bronchial stent was inserted in the right main bronchus to reopen the airway and control tumor bleeding through the tamponade effect. During the bronchogram, it was decided to sacrifice the superior segment of the right lower bronchus to preserve the basal segments of the right lower lobe. The stent inserted was 12 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up regularly to monitor the condition and make necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition closely. Address any new symptoms or concerns as they arise. Regular follow-up appointments are essential to ensure the effectiveness of the current treatment strategy.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the importance of regular follow-up and encouraged to report any new symptoms or concerns promptly.
