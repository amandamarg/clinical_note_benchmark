**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:31:09 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Headaches for the past three months, suspected sinusitis.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing headaches for the past three months, initially suspected to be due to sinusitis. The patient has taken several courses of antibiotics without relief. The patient describes a sensation of fullness and a lump in the midline of the forehead over the frontal sinus region. Sinus radiographs indicated sinusitis, leading to a referral to an otolaryngologist. A CT scan revealed a bone destructive lesion of the frontal sinus, and an MRI confirmed the presence of a frontal sinus tumour. A biopsy identified the tumour as squamous cell carcinoma.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Mild hyperlipidemia.

**Family History:**  
- No family history of sinus cancer.

**Medications:**  
- None.

**Social History:**  
- Non-smoker.
- Consumes alcohol two to three times a week.

**Physical Examination:**  
- A poorly-defined smooth swelling approximately 4 cm in width was noted on the forehead.
- Normal skin sensation on the forehead bilaterally.
- No palpable masses present in the head and neck.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the frontal sinus. We discussed treatment options and agreed that the optimal approach is surgical resection of the primary tumour, followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy. The procedure will be conducted conjointly by the head and neck and neurosurgery teams.
