**Patient:** [Patient's Name]

**Chief Complaint:** Loose and extruded right front tooth.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient presented with a complaint of a loose and extruded right front tooth, specifically the right lateral incisor. The tooth had moved labially, resulting in an unesthetic appearance. Examination revealed a deep periodontal pocket distally and Grade II mobility of the tooth.

**Examination and Findings:** An intraoral periapical radiograph showed bone loss distally reaching the apical third of the root along with periapical radiolucency.

**Treatment Plan and Procedures:**
1. Initial treatment included thorough scaling and root planning, followed by patient education on plaque control measures.
2. Root canal treatment was performed on the affected tooth to eliminate the periapical source of infection.
3. After 6 weeks, reassessment showed reduced mobility to Grade I and satisfactory plaque control.
4. Two weeks post-reassessment, periodontal flap surgery was performed in the maxillary right lateral incisor area to eliminate the deep periodontal infection. Thorough root planning and debridement revealed a deep defect distal to the lateral incisor.
5. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) was placed in the defect to aid in bone regeneration and expedite healing. 3.0 silk sutures were placed, and a Coe pack dressing was applied.
6. After 8 weeks, reassessment showed a probing pocket depth reduced to 3 mm in the distal site, but no spontaneous closure of the anterior space.
7. A modified crown preparation was performed on the affected tooth to close the anterior space and provide long-term support to the root canal treated tooth.

**Follow-Up and Outcome:** Six months post-treatment, the patient presented with clinically healthy gingiva and a probing pocket depth of 3 mm. Post-treatment radiographic evaluation indicated significant bone fill in the defect.

**Plan:** Continue with regular plaque control measures. The patient is advised to return for follow-up if any concerns arise.
