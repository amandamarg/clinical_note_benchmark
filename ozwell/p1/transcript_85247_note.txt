**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:36:22 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Incident:** Road accident approximately 20 days ago  
- **Current Issue:** Fractured upper incisors  

**Examination Findings:**  
- **Upper Incisors:** Complicated crown fracture observed  
- **Swelling:** Present with a sinus tract on the labial gingiva between the upper right central and lateral incisor  
- **Radiographic Findings:**  
  - Horizontal fracture at the middle third of the root of the upper right central and lateral incisors  
  - No mobility of the coronal fragment  
  - Upper left central and lateral incisors are intact and have undergone previous endodontic treatment  

**Treatment Plan:**  
1. Initiate endodontic treatment for the upper right central and lateral incisors.  
2. Determine the working length accurately.  
3. Clean and shape the canals using K files in a step-back manner to an apical file size #60.  
4. Shape the canals to obtain a uniform taper from the apex towards the coronal.  
5. Administer an interappointment calcium hydroxide dressing and schedule a recall after 7 days.  
6. On the second visit, once swelling has resolved, sectionally obturate the root canals with gutta percha cone and AH plus sealer.  
   - Select a gutta percha cone of size #60 with a taper of 2%.  
   - Try the cone into the canal for a snug fit.  
   - Cut the cone to obtain a section 2-3 mm short of the apical fragment of the root.  
   - Select a suitable plugger fitting 2-3 mm short of the apical root fragment and set a stopper at this length.  
   - Coat the sectioned gutta percha with AH plus.  

**Patient Consent:**  
- The patient has been informed of the treatment plan and has given consent to proceed.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Begin the treatment as outlined.
