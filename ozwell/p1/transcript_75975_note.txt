**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Referred by:** Orthodontist  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Referred for evaluation of ectopic upper left canine and jaw expansion.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred by their orthodontist for an ectopic upper left canine and some expansion in the jaw. The patient reports no symptoms.

**Examination:**  
- Intraoral examination revealed firm, bony expansion between teeth 22 and 24. The overlying mucosa appeared normal, and teeth 22 and 24 were not mobile.

**Radiographic Examination:**  
- Radiographic examination showed an ectopic 23 tooth with a possible large cystic radiolucency surrounding the canine. No evidence of root resorption of teeth 22 and 24.

**Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CT):**  
- CT showed expanded bone in the 23 region with a normal trabecular pattern and intact buccal and palatal cortices, with some buccal cortical expansion. The 23 was located in the zygomatic bone, with the crown facing buccally and causing dehiscence of the zygomatic bone. The roots were facing toward the left maxillary sinus with the dilacerated apex projecting into the sinus.

**Exploration and Biopsy:**  
- Exploration of the 23 region under general anesthetic was performed, along with a bone biopsy of the lesion and a left middle meatal antroscopy. The 23 was not visible during examination of the left maxillary sinus. The expanded buccal bone appeared firm but abnormal looking with slight bleeding.

**Histopathology Results:**  
- Histopathology showed vital lamellar bone with a uniform osteoblast layer and minimal evidence of resorption. The soft tissue component was a mixture of adipose and highly vascular fibrous tissue. Numerous blood vessels ranged widely in size, some having muscle wall and appeared to be displacing adipose tissue. These findings were compatible with a diagnosis of an IH (Intraosseous Hemangioma).

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The exact cause of buccal alveolar expansion and migration of the 23 is still unclear. On review, there was no further evidence of bony expansion or active hemorrhage from the lesion. Although the 23 was positioned in the zygomatic bone, there was no cystic evidence.
- The patient is advised to return for a follow-up visit in a few months to monitor the condition. The patient is instructed to return if any symptoms develop.

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule follow-up visit in a few months.
