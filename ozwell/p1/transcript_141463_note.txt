**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:33:42 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with concerns about memory problems, as reported by their family. The patient described having trouble remembering things and sometimes getting confused about who people are.

**Objective:**  
During the consultation, the patient recounted an incident where they were discussing family matters with their own image in the mirror, identifying the image as an old friend. The patient had no issues recognizing others in the mirror. However, when seeing their children directly, the patient believed they were impostors, although they could recognize them by voice or reflected images. The patient insisted that the people in front did not carry the familiar emotions and mannerisms of their children. Recognition was consistent when the children communicated from another room or when their reflected images were shown. The patient also felt the presence of an old friend next to the image of the children in the mirror.

**Assessment:**  
The symptoms and behaviors described are suggestive of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the issues with direct recognition versus recognition through reflection or voice.

**Plan:**  
1. Conduct further tests to confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
2. Provide instructions on follow-up requirements to help manage the condition.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient agreed to undergo further testing and receive follow-up instructions for managing their condition.
