**Chief Complaint:**  
Painful swelling in the left leg.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a painful swelling in the left leg, which began 11 years ago following a puncture wound by a nail. Initial treatment was received at another hospital. A year later, a slowly growing mass appeared in the popliteal fossa. The patient sought care at a cardiovascular surgery department, where Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography identified a popliteal pseudoaneurysm near the bifurcation to the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. Surgical excision of the pseudoaneurysm and repair of the popliteal artery were performed. Post-surgery, the popliteal artery was patent per Doppler USG, but the patient experienced a foot drop, which resolved spontaneously after a year.

A gradually expanding mass recurred in the popliteal fossa during early follow-up. Cardiovascular surgery recommended observation. Five years later, Doppler ultrasonography showed monophasic flow in the popliteal artery. Over the past 10 years, the patient visited multiple medical centers, all of which suggested observation without intervention. The patient now presents with a large popliteal mass and an obstructed popliteal artery.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Large mass (28 Ã— 10 cm) in the popliteal fossa with old surgical scars.  
- Lesion is soft, fluctuant, and painless on palpation.  
- Neurological examination of the lower leg is normal.  
- Blood tests are normal.

**Imaging Studies:**  
- Arteriography: Popliteal artery occluded in the proximal section, filled in the distal section with collateral vessels.  
- MRI: Enormous soft tissue mass of 115.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has a large popliteal mass associated with an obstructed popliteal artery. Surgical intervention is recommended to remove the mass and repair the popliteal artery. Regular follow-up post-surgery is necessary to ensure proper recovery and monitor for any recurrence.

**Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to rest well before the scheduled surgery.

**Follow-Up:**  
Surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible. Regular follow-up appointments will be arranged post-surgery.
