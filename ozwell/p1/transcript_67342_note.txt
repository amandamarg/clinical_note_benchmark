**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:41 PM  

**Diagnosis:** Recurrent lower gingival squamous cell carcinoma in the right side of the mandible.

**Symptoms:** Patient reports a persistent sore in the right jaw.

**Planned Procedure:** Segmental resection of the mandible including surrounding soft tissue with a 10-mm safety margin.

**Preoperative Preparation:**  
- A surgical simulation and preparation of the surgical device were performed using a 3D model.  
- The right and left mandibular rami were connected in the 3D model to maintain the preoperative position between the proximal and distal segments.  
- Segmental resection was simulated on the 3D model with a safety margin of at least 10 mm from the tumor.  
- Due to the extensive resection required, provisional fixation of the reconstruction plate on the mandible before resection was not possible.  
- A surgical device was designed to guide the direction of bone cutting and restore preoperative condylar head positioning in the temporomandibular fossa. The device was made to fit the lower border of the anterior mandible and the posterior border of the mandibular ramus.  
- The surgical device featured a U-shaped handle and holes for fixation on the mandible with screws.  
- A titanium reconstruction plate was pre-bent to fit the area of resection in the 3D model.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Segmental mandibular resection was performed via a submandibular approach.  
- The surgical device was fixed on the mandible with two screws each at the proximal and distal segments.  
- Mandibular resection was executed along the proximal and distal edges of the device fixed to the mandible.  
- The pre-bent titanium reconstruction plate was fixed on the proximal and distal segments with screws, after which the screws used to fix the surgical device were removed.

**Follow-up:** Patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to ensure proper healing.
