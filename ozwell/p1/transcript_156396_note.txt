**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with a pregnancy wish and provided a detailed medical history. She has a history of subvalvular membranous aortic stenosis, with surgical resection of the membrane at ages 7 and 14. As a young adult, she developed recurrent severe subvalvular stenosis, which became symptomatic. At age 21, she underwent a Morrow procedure for radical resection of the membrane and a Konno procedure to widen the left ventricular outflow tract. Post-operation, she was symptom-free and did not require medication.

**Objective:**  
Echocardiogram findings indicate septal akinesia with an LV diastolic diameter of 57 mm at the basal level and a normal midventricular diameter of 52 mm. The LV ejection fraction is 50%. The aortic valve is abnormal with grade I regurgitation and valvular aortic stenosis, with peak and mean gradients of 27 and 15 mmHg, respectively. The patient is graded as pregnancy risk WHO class II [â€“] (low-moderate risk) due to mild aortic valve dysfunction and local wall motion abnormality of the LV.

**Past Obstetric History:**  
The patient became pregnant in 2007 and was monitored in the cardiac service at 20, 26, and 34 weeks. During pregnancy, LV diameters, ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, and regurgitation remained stable. In the second trimester, she developed dyspnoea on exertion, attributed to pregnancy and moderate overweight. In the last weeks of pregnancy, she gained 8 kg in 2 weeks and experienced increased dyspnoea. Despite concerns about fluid retention and potential heart failure, the weight gain was deemed normal by a junior gynaecologist, and the cardiologist was not consulted. Delivery was induced at 39 weeks, resulting in a healthy daughter delivered by secondary caesarean section.

**Postpartum History:**  
Two months postpartum, the patient was admitted for bradycardia due to 2nd degree AV block, and a DDDR pacemaker was inserted.

**Plan:**  
Given the patient's history and current condition, close monitoring and follow-up appointments are recommended to track any changes in her condition.
