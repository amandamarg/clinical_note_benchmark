**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Large right breast mass present for 2 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a large right breast mass that has been present for 2 years. The mass is swollen and mildly tender. There is no personal or family history of breast cancer. The patient had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy at 46 years of age. The first menstrual period was at age 13, and the patient has never been pregnant.

**Physical Examination:**  
The patient is a well-nourished female with an obvious mass of the right breast measuring 36 Ã— 30 cm at the time of presentation. The skin of the breast was blue at the apex of the mass, and the nipple was massively enlarged and excoriated. On initial presentation, there was no evidence of skin breakdown, but by the time of surgery, the patient had experienced loss of skin integrity. The contralateral breast was of normal size, with no significant masses on palpation. There was no palpable adenopathy in either of the axillary basins.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Fine needle aspiration showed highly atypical cells suspicious of a malignant neoplasm.
- Core tissue biopsy showed mixed epithelial-stromal proliferation suggestive of a phyllodes tumor.
- CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and head showed no evidence of distant metastasis but suggested invasion of the tumor into the chest wall.

**Surgical Management:**  
Due to the invasion of the tumor into the chest wall, initial surgical management involved tumor resection, and breast reconstruction was deferred. A right simple mastectomy was performed. Superior and inferior skin flaps were designed to allow skin approximation and closure after removal of the large tumor. The superior flap was raised to the level of the clavicle, and the dissection revealed that the blood supply to the tumor was derived largely from collateral vessels arising from the skin. These vessels were large and friable, yet easily managed using standard techniques. The inferior flap was then raised, demonstrating tumor involvement.

**Plan:**  
The patient was advised to return if any new symptoms arise. Further follow-up and management will be based on the patient's recovery and any additional findings.

**Patient Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient had no further questions or concerns at this time.
