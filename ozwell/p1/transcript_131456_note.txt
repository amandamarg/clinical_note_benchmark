**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:14:25 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Rapidly enlarging mass on left shoulder for the past 2 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a mass on the left shoulder that has been rapidly enlarging over the past 2 months. The mass developed over a presumed keloid scar that formed approximately 1 month following a motor vehicle accident 12 years ago. During the accident, the patient suffered a contusion to the left shoulder, which initially bruised and then formed a golf ball-sized mass, without any breakage of skin. The patient was diagnosed with a keloid at that time, which was consistent with their past medical and family history. No treatment was received for the lesion, which remained stable in shape, color, and size until 1.5 years prior to evaluation. At that time, the patient experienced a minor trauma to the lesion during a work-related injury, which did not break the skin barrier. Subsequently, the lesion slowly increased in size under the skin without apparent cutaneous changes. Two months prior to this encounter, the patient noticed a new, rapidly growing nodule on the surface of the initial mass. The patient also reports limited range of motion of the neck, which has become more prominent as the mass increased in size.

**Physical Examination:**  
- The mass on the left shoulder consists of three discrete protuberant tumor nodules, gray-white in color, involving the skin and subcutis. The largest nodule measures 16 × 15 × 7 cm, and the smallest nodule measures 7 × 6 × 3 cm.  
- The tumor is ulcerated and necrotic, without apparent attachment to underlying structures.  
- No masses observed in the anterior cervical, posterior cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes.

**Imaging:**  
- CT of the thorax suggests that the masses are superficial with no attachment to underlying bone or great vessels. There is no evidence of metastatic disease or adenopathy.

**Procedure:**  
- A wide excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed.

**Histological Examination:**  
- Pending results.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Await histological examination results to determine the nature of the mass and appropriate further management.  
- Monitor for any changes in the mass or additional symptoms.  
- Consider referral to oncology for further evaluation and management based on biopsy results.
