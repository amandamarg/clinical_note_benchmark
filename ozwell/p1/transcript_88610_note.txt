**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:00:18 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Injury:** Right ankle sprain  
- **Previous Study Participation:** Asymptomatic control group in a study on muscle onset timing of posterior leg and trunk muscles during prone leg extension  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient participated in a study a few months ago and recently suffered a right ankle sprain while camping. X-rays were performed, showing no fractures. The patient was advised to perform daily weight-bearing exercises and range of motion exercises. At two weeks post-injury, the patient reported functioning at 60% of their optimum. By 8 weeks post-injury, the patient was running 95% pain-free with little loss of function. No passive therapy was received.

**Study Details:**  
- The patient agreed to have their results published for the second half of the study after being notified of the risks and benefits.  
- The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC.  
- The same testing protocol was used across the 3 experimental days.

**Current Status:**  
The patient's ankle is much better now. 

**Plan:**  
- Perform tests to determine if the ankle injury influences the timing of muscle activation during prone leg extension compared to an injury-free onset timing pattern.  
- Monitor the patient's weight.  
- Continue with weight-bearing exercises and range of motion exercises.

**Follow-Up:**  
Tests will be scheduled, and the patient is advised to continue their current exercise regimen.
