**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:26:44 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with a recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma on the lip, chin, neck, cheek, and mandible.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma and has previously undergone resections of the lower lip carcinoma and a left tonsillectomy a year ago. Postoperative radiation and chemotherapy were administered. The patient now presents with a recurrence of the cancer and osteoradionecrosis of the mandible.

**Planned Surgical Procedure:**  
- Composite resection of the tumor and bilateral neck dissection.
- Reconstruction using a free fibula flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 17 × 8 cm and a 2.4-mm reconstruction plate.
- A closing wedge osteotomy at the area of the mandibular symphysis on the fibula to allow for the bend of the fibula into the contours of the mandible.
- External soft tissue reconstruction using an ALT flap from the right leg with a skin paddle measuring 14 × 22 cm.
- The left lingual artery and the internal jugular vein will serve as recipient vessels for the free fibula flap.
- The ALT flap will be anastomosed to the ipsilateral facial artery and the internal jugular vein.
- Restoration of oral competence using a tensor fascia lata sling anchored bilaterally on the anterior aspect of the zygoma.

**Postoperative Complications and Management:**  
On postoperative day 3, the patient presented with an acute arterial thrombosis of the ALT artery. The arterial anastomosis was revised, employing the left ascending pharyngeal artery as a recipient vessel for reanastomosis to the ALT artery. Despite the revision, the flap progressed to total necrosis likely due to the no reflow phenomenon.

**Secondary Surgical Intervention:**  
A second ALT flap was performed from the left thigh with a 14 × 26 cm skin paddle. An end-to-side anastomosis was conducted between the ALT artery and the right common carotid artery. The right internal jugular vein served as the recipient vessel for the venous anastomosis. The right neck was chosen for the anastomosis.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
The patient has been informed of the procedures and complications and has expressed understanding and agreement with the treatment plan.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely for any further complications and will be provided with additional information and support as needed. Further follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and address any concerns.
