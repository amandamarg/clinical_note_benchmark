**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:20:47 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Burn accident covering 85% of body surface area.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient experienced a severe burn accident affecting 85% of their body surface area. Following the initial assessment, the patient underwent debridement in the operating room and was subsequently admitted to the general systems intensive care unit due to acute renal failure, likely caused by myoglobulinuria. The patient received treatment for burns in both the intensive care unit and the burn unit, undergoing several operations including multiple debridements and allograft applications.

**Complications During Hospital Stay:**  
- Multiple infections  
- Pancreatitis  
- Deep vein thrombosis  
- Pleural effusion  
- Cardiomyopathy  
- Chronic diarrhea  
- Depression  
- Upper airway and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding secondary to ulcers  
- Acute kidney injury, thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis  
- Elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver function tests, which corrected with discontinuation of certain medications  

**Hospital Course:**  
The acute care admission lasted approximately 15 months, during which the patient underwent 33 operations/procedures before being transferred to a rehabilitation unit. The patient was worked up for anemia, requiring massive RBC transfusions to maintain an average hemoglobin value of 95 g/L, with fluctuations into the low 70s necessitating blood products. The anemia was attributed to multiple gastrointestinal bleeds presenting with melena. The possibility of hemolysis was considered due to occasional elevated lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin values, positive direct antiglobulin tests, but normal haptoglobin levels and minimal morphological evidence of hemolysis on peripheral blood smears. Chronic anemia was managed with multiple RBC transfusions throughout the hospital admission.

**Nutritional Deficiencies:**  
The patient had multiple zinc, selenium, and copper serum values monitored during the hospital stay.

**Plan:**  
Review medical records and discuss next steps with the patient.
