**Chief Complaint:**  
Fever and pain in the left cervical region.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with fever and pain in the left cervical region, which began approximately 20 days after treatment for an ischemic stroke. The patient was previously admitted with an acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, treated with venous thrombolysis. Investigations revealed critical stenosis of the left ICA and 50%â€“69% stenosis of the right ICA on Doppler ultrasound. Angiography showed occlusion of the right ICA with reperfusion on vasa vasorum and 90% stenosis of the left ICA. The patient underwent angioplasty with stent placement in the left ICA 14 days post-stroke, with uneventful anesthetic and endovascular procedures, and was discharged 2 days post-intervention without complaints.

The patient presented to the emergency department 20 days post-treatment with fever. A DUS of the carotid arteries showed mild intimal hyperplasia within the stent. Blood culture revealed vancomycin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, with several septic teeth in the oral cavity suggestive of Ludwig's angina. The patient was started on antibiotic therapy but experienced worsening pain in the left cervical region and formation of a subcutaneous collection with local edema. A second control DUS showed fluid in the muscle planes around the stent graft, and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed infection at the stent site. A second cerebral angiography showed minor irregularities at the stent site with mild intimal hyperplasia.

The patient remained hospitalized for 3 weeks on ceftazidime and vancomycin therapy, with a stable clinical course and slight improvement of cervical edema. A second cervical NMR was performed due to an increase in the cervical collection, revealing a giant pseudoaneurysm of the treated artery, confirmed by angiography. The case was discussed with the vascular surgery team, and due to contralateral ICA occlusion, bypass surgery for stent resection was not considered a viable option, nor was endovascular occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment. The patient is instructed to return to the emergency department immediately if there is any worsening of symptoms.
