**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** Susan  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
Susan reports worsening pain and difficulty with daily activities. She has a history of scoliosis and underwent carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand during her time as a hairstylist. Despite various treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, her symptoms persist. She notes that certain yoga movements and swimming strokes exacerbate her pain. 

In her early forties, Susan began experiencing weakness in her lower body, with her legs giving out on stairs and a loss of bladder and bowel control. An MRI led to emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. Unfortunately, the surgery resulted in paralysis on her right side, requiring an 8-week hospital stay for rehabilitation. A subsequent surgery for pain relief worsened her condition. She currently receives weekly injections for pain relief, which provide marginal relief for about one week. She also experiences heightened sensitivity in her legs, where even a bed sheet can cause pain.

**Objective:**  
- History of scoliosis and carpal tunnel surgery.
- Post-surgical complications including right-side paralysis and ongoing severe pain.
- Heightened sensitivity in legs.

**Assessment:**  
Susan's symptoms and medical history suggest ongoing issues related to her spinal condition and post-surgical complications. The current pain management strategy is insufficient, and further evaluation is necessary to develop a more effective treatment plan.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule follow-up tests to assess current spinal condition and explore alternative treatment options.
- Continue weekly pain relief injections while exploring additional pain management strategies.
- Monitor and address any new symptoms or changes in condition.

**Instructions:**  
Susan is advised to contact the clinic with any questions or concerns. Further tests and evaluations will be scheduled to determine a more effective treatment plan.
