**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and previous injuries to the left leg, including a tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago with open reduction and internal fixation, and a sciatic nerve injury. Eight years later, the patient sustained a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture, treated with open reduction, internal fixation, and stent insertion in the femoral artery.

**Current Symptoms:**
- Pain and swelling in the left leg, with erythematous changes on the anterolateral aspect.
- Limited motion in the ankle and toes, with sensory reduction in the foot due to the sciatic nerve injury.

**Physical Examination:**
- Ankle dorsiflexion at 0 degrees and plantar flexion at 5 degrees.
- Clawing deformity in all toes.
- Motor strength: Ankle dorsiflexion grade 0, plantar flexion grade 3.
- Sensory examination: No sensation in the first web space and medial aspect of the foot, with sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.

**Radiographic Findings:**
- Widespread radiopaque mass observed on the left leg.
- Radiographs from 10 years ago showed a mass that developed over time.

**Clinical Course:**
- After admission, the patient was maintained with a long leg splint.
- Two weeks post-admission, erythematous changes localized to the anterior aspect of the middle leg, forming a fluid-filled, erythematous mass.
- A draining sinus developed spontaneously on the erythematous mass, discharging thick fluid with chalk-like material.

**Angiography Findings:**
- Obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation.

**Outcome:**
- The patient unfortunately passed away.
