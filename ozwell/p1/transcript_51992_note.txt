**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Generalized pain in the right leg.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to the emergency department with generalized pain in the right leg. The patient reports loss of sensation in some parts of the right leg and inability to move it. The patient denies experiencing any loss of consciousness, amnesia, or headache. The patient is a smoker and an occasional drinker. There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or medication use.

Two weeks ago, the patient was involved in a motorcycle accident, crashing into a truck with the right leg being the focus of impact. A plain X-Ray was taken with suspicion of an open fracture. The patient was alert, complained of intense pain, and was unable to move the right leg. The patient discharged against medical advice and sought home treatment with a traditional bone setter.

After 24 hours, the patient experienced intense pain, swelling, and numbness throughout the right leg. The patient developed a fever, foul-smelling discharge, and progressive darkening of the limb. Vital signs reported as blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg and pulse.

**Assessment:**  
The patient's right leg is in critical condition, likely due to complications from the untreated open fracture and subsequent infection.

**Plan:**  
Immediate surgical intervention is necessary. The surgery is scheduled for tomorrow.
