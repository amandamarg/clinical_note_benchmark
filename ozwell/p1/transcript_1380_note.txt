**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:59:30 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling in the right jaw.  
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient reports a swelling in the right jaw, which developed three months ago due to an infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but the treatment was ineffective.  

**Medical History:**  
- No past or congenital diseases specified in the medical history.  

**Clinical Examination:**  
- Severe swelling in the right jaw without fluctuation upon palpation.  
- Submandibular lymphadenopathy in the right mandibular region.  
- Normal skin color and appearance.  

**Oral Examination:**  
- Right mandibular first molar tooth has a deep caries cavity and is not mobile.  

**Radiographic Examination:**  
- Deep caries cavity and a radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- Lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible and at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus, showing focal new bone formation.  

**Cone-Beam Computed Tomography:**  
- Tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  
- Bone deposition at the radiolucent area in the center at the lower edge of the mandible and the vestibule surface in this region.  

**Diagnosis:**  
- Garre's osteomyelitis due to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.  

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Endodontic treatment was considered primarily to retain the infected tooth in the mouth. However, due to the patient's location in a remote rural area and the prohibitive cost of such treatment, the patient was transferred to the surgical clinic. The most appropriate treatment method was considered to be dental extraction.
