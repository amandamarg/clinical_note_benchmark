**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:01:04 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient was admitted with 40% acute flame burns on the neck, chest, anterior abdominal wall, and upper limbs. The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries 10 years ago due to tuberculosis, including an exploratory laparotomy that resulted in a burst abdomen and a temporary colostomy. Subsequently, the patient developed a large ventral hernia. Five years later, the patient underwent an open mesh repair, which became infected and was removed. Upon presentation, the ventral hernia had second-degree deep dermal burns, which were grafted. After rehabilitation from the burn wounds, the patient returned for ventral hernia repair.

- **Surgical Plan and Procedure:** The patient has a Type 2 abdominal wall defect. The option of a microvascular free flap was considered but deferred. The planned procedure involved a TFL graft harvested from the left thigh to close the rectus defect and an islanded TFL myocutaneous flap from the right thigh for the abdominal defect. During surgery, the edge of the hernia was incised, and skin adherent to the peritoneum was excised, revealing a 20 cm x 12 cm defect in the lower two-thirds of the midline of the abdomen. A fascia lata graft measuring 18 cm x 10 cm was harvested from the left thigh and sutured to the edge of the abdominal wall. On the right side, a TFL islanded flap measuring 30 cm x 10 cm was elevated and turned 120Â° to allow the distal end of the flap to reach the upper limit of the abdominal defect. The segment between the proximal end of the flap and the lower end of the abdominal defect in the right iliac region was incised and opened up to the external fascia to accommodate the bridging segment of the flap. The fascia was reinforced to the inside wall edge, and the skin was sutured with a closed suction drain.

- **Postoperative Course:** The postoperative period was uneventful, and the closed suction drain was removed.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient is recovering well post-surgery with no complications reported. The patient has no questions or concerns at this time. The patient is advised to return if any issues arise.
