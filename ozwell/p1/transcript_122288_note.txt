**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Follow-up after attempted pacemaker placement and vascular surgery.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital three days ago with a transient ischemic attack and new onset atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent an attempted pacemaker placement due to sinus bradycardia. During the procedure, after the placement of the five French sheath, arterial blood return was noted, and the procedure was aborted. A CT scan was performed to evaluate for arterial injury, revealing direct cannulation of the aortic knob with the sheath. The patient was then transferred to our institution for a higher level of vascular surgery care.

Upon arrival, the patient was intubated and sedated with the sheath in place in the left chest, covered with a dressing, and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output. The patient was taken to the hybrid operating room where two proglide devices were placed in the left access using the standard preclose technique, as this was the anticipated site of device deployment. A pigtail catheter was advanced into the ascending aorta, and an arch aortogram was performed, demonstrating direct cannulation of the aortic knob.

Due to the patient's comorbidities and advanced age, which posed prohibitive risks for open repair, we elected to proceed with stent graft placement to manage the injury. Prior to the placement of an endoprosthesis, a cerebral angiogram was performed to identify cerebrovascular dominance, demonstrating a dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia. There was adequate distance from the site of sheath insertion to the left subclavian artery, allowing for a seal without covering the left subclavian artery. Based on preoperative measurements of the anticipated proximal and distal seal zones, the procedure was completed successfully.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's recovery post-procedure.
- Follow up in a few days to assess the patient's progress.
- Address any questions or concerns the patient may have during the next visit.
