**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Knee injury

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a knee injury sustained while skiing a few days ago. Initial treatment at a local medical office included a brace. The patient reports significant swelling and pain in the knee, with pain exacerbated by movement. The patient is unable to bear weight on the affected knee.

**Physical Examination:**
- Marked swelling in the knee joint.
- Pain on passive mobilization.
- Limited range of motion: knee flexion to 40°, inability to extend.
- Inability to bear weight on the knee.
- Obvious gap at the level of the insertion of the patellar tendon on the lower pole of the patella.
- >10 mm widening of the medial joint line with valgus stress in 30° of flexion and full extension, indicating complete MCL tear.
- No clinical evidence of instability in other knee ligaments.

**Imaging:**
- X-ray: Superior migration of the patella.
- MRI: Confirmed complete tear of the MCL at its proximal insertion on the medial femoral condyle and complete rupture of the patellar tendon at its insertion on the lower pole of the patella. No lesions of the cruciate ligaments and menisci.

**Medical History:**
- Lower back pain due to a herniated disc, treated conservatively.
- Previous episodes of pain in the left patellar tendon while jogging, with no specific treatment prescribed.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Surgery performed 5 days post-accident under epidural anesthesia.
- Clinical examination under anesthesia confirmed complete instability of the MCL with valgus stress.
- Patellar tendon approached via anterior longitudinal midline incision.
- Debridement of tendinous tissue at the tear site.
- Krackow-stitch placed in the patellar tendon distally to the tear, with loops passed through two bony tunnels.

**Plan:**
- Rest and follow rehabilitation instructions.
- Patient advised to contact the clinic with any questions or concerns.
