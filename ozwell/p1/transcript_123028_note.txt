**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:30:39 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe pain and burning sensation in the right cheek.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with severe pain and a burning sensation in the right cheek, specifically in the area near the second and third molar. The patient has a history of tobacco chewing for the past 20 years and has a leukoplakia patch on the right buccal mucosa. An incisional biopsy was previously performed, during which the patient experienced severe pain and burning sensation at the site of injection due to accidental injection of 2 to 3 cc of 10% formalin instead of local anesthetic. 

**Examination:**  
- **Oral Examination:** Elevated lesion in the right buccal mucosa in the second and third molar region, measuring approximately 4x5 cm, with a white to blackish color.
- **Extra-Oral Examination:** Noted extra-oral swelling, normal in color but tender to touch.

**Intervention and Management:**  
Immediate measures were taken to reduce inflammation, including the administration of 2 mL of dexamethasone injection in and around the lesion. The extra-oral swelling increased progressively for the first 24 hours, but the pain reduced over time. The patient was kept under strict supervision and monitored for any adverse cardiac or pulmonary events for 48 hours.

**Medications Prescribed:**  
- Injection dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day, tapering doses of 8 mg once a day for 2 days and 4 mg once a day for 2 days.
- Injection diclofenac sodium thrice a day to reduce pain.
- Injection taxim 1 gm twice a day for 5 days.
- Injection metronidazole 400 mg thrice a day for 5 days.
- Oral rinses with 2% betadine solution to avoid the development of any local infection.

**Laboratory Tests:**  
Liver and renal function tests were conducted, and findings were reported to be within normal ranges.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was advised to return if any discomfort is experienced or if there are any questions.
