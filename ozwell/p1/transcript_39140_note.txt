**Clinical Note**

**Patient History:**
The patient presented with a history of pain and deformity in both arms, which has been ongoing for a long period. The patient reported having synthol injections in the biceps four years ago, with a total of 16 injections in each bicep administered four times a week for four weeks. Post-injection, the patient experienced pain and pressure, initially rated at 4 out of 10, which gradually increased to 6 out of 10. Despite the pain, the patient continued training sessions until the pain became severe, reaching a 7 out of 10, leading to the cessation of training after two years. The pain was described as constant and persistent, becoming intolerable over time.

**Physical Examination:**
The examination revealed rubbery firm hypertrophic and dysmorphic biceps in both arms with a free range of motion. The patient reported constant painful pressure within the right muscle more than the left, along with muscle deformity and several tender points throughout the biceps muscle.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, revealing a swollen right biceps muscle with cystic lesions scattered throughout the muscle tissue, exhibiting a hyperintense signal. These lesions were identified as oil deposits between muscle fibers, known as oleomas. The MRI indicated fibrotic changes in the muscle's appearance and inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, suggesting the presence of inflammation.

**Treatment:**
Due to ongoing pain and lack of therapeutic alternatives, an open surgical excision of the anterior third of the biceps was performed through an anterior bicipital approach.

**Intraoperative Findings:**
The surgery revealed no common muscle tissue remaining, but rather massive fibrotic tissue.

**Outcome:**
The surgical excision was successful. The patient was advised to take good care of themselves and adhere strictly to aftercare instructions.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient was instructed to contact the physician with any questions or concerns.
