**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing a headache, vertigo, and nausea. These symptoms began on the 24th post-traumatic day and have not been responsive to oral analgesics and antiemetic drugs. The patient has a history of head trauma from a car accident, which resulted in hospitalization and a subsequent diagnosis of a combined right supra-subtentorial hematoma.

**Objective:**  
- Initial brain CT scan post-accident showed a combined right supra-subtentorial hematoma.
- Clinical evaluation post-accident revealed only a mild headache with no significant neurological signs.
- Brain MRI confirmed the presence of the hematoma involving the supratentorial and subtentorial compartments, with occlusion of the right transverse sinus.
- Conservative management was adopted due to the absence of neurological signs and patency of the contralateral dural sinuses system.
- Follow-up CT scan 48 hours post-accident showed a slight increase in hematoma size.
- By the 10th post-traumatic day, CT scans showed a progressive decrease in hematoma size.
- LMWH administration began, and the patient was discharged on the 15th post-traumatic day.
- No symptoms related to the trauma were reported during the subsequent 23 days.
- On the 24th post-traumatic day, the patient reported mild headache, vertigo, and nausea.
- A new brain CT scan showed a further reduction in the size of both hematomas.

**Assessment:**  
The patient is experiencing symptoms of mild headache, vertigo, and nausea, which are not responsive to oral medications. Given the clinical history and recent CT findings, further investigation is warranted.

**Plan:**  
- Perform a new brain MRI to ensure there are no underlying issues contributing to the patient's current symptoms.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be contacted with the results of the MRI and further management will be determined based on the findings.
