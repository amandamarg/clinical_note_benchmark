**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habits, including the passage of mucus and increased stool frequency, persisting for approximately 6 months. The patient reported no abdominal pain or weight changes. The patient expressed feeling nervous during the consultation.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Born with bladder exstrophy.  
- Multiple surgeries, including cystectomy with ileal conduit formation at age 5.  
- Recurrent urinary tract infections throughout childhood and adulthood.  
- No major co-morbidities or risk factors for colorectal malignancy.  
- No family history of colorectal disease.

**Objective:**  
Colonoscopy findings included two large sessile polyps in the sigmoid colon with irregular patterns suggestive of focally advanced disease. The polyps were removed during surgery, and histological examination confirmed adenomas with both low and high-grade dysplasia, without submucosal invasion. Atypical mucosa was noted around a diverticulum-like structure, but it was not adenomatous. No other evidence of diverticular disease or polyps was found elsewhere in the colon.

**Assessment:**  
The patient had adenomatous polyps with dysplasia, necessitating surgical intervention due to difficult endoscopic access and suspected intra-abdominal adhesions from previous pelvic surgeries.

**Plan:**  
The patient underwent a high anterior resection with an open approach to ensure complete removal of abnormal tissue. An end colostomy was formed at the patient's pre-operative request. During the laparotomy, the right fallopian tube was found adherent to the sigmoid colon, and a blind-ending tube from the anti-mesenteric border of the colon was marked for pathological identification. The patient had an uneventful recovery and reported good quality of life post-surgery. The patient confirmed the desire for a permanent colostomy.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient did not express the need for further follow-up appointments at this time but was advised to contact the office with any concerns or questions.
