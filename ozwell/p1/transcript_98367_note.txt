**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the left leg for the past 6 months. The pain began after being tackled from the side while playing football 2 years ago, at which time the patient had immediate pain in the same location as a previous tibia fracture. The patient went to the emergency room and was treated with a splint, followed by a cast for 6 weeks and a boot for 4 weeks. The patient experienced mild occasional aching pain for about 2 years post-injury. After the recent tackle, the pain persisted for 6 months, accompanied by numbness and tingling in the tips of the toes.

**Objective:**  
- Initial assessment at our institution showed normal appearance of the left leg with no swelling or deformity, but tenderness to touch.  
- No neurologic deficit or sensory problems were noted; motor and sensory function were normal throughout the lower extremities.  
- Radiographs indicated an apparent channel in the lateral aspect of the distal tibia, consistent with a partial nonunion.  
- CT scan revealed a tubular channel running through the lateral cortex of the distal third of the tibia at the previous fracture site.  
- MRI demonstrated the anterior tibial artery and deep peroneal nerve embedded within the lateral distal tibial cortex.

**Assessment:**  
The findings suggest possible entrapment of the neurovascular bundle in the tibia, which may be causing the patient's pain and numbness.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule the patient for additional imaging tests and a physical examination to confirm the diagnosis.  
- Consider referral to a specialist if necessary for further evaluation and management.
