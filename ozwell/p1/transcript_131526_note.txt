**Chief Complaint:**  
Evaluation and treatment of a biceps tendon rupture on the left arm.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient is a cabinet maker who sustained an injury to the left arm when a heavy door fell toward him. He attempted to catch it with his left arm, experiencing a sharp pain and tearing sensation in the elbow. The patient reported the injury to his employer but was not referred for medical attention. He continued working, relying mostly on his dominant arm. Over the subsequent months, the patient noticed increasing weakness in elbow flexion and supination, along with increasing deformity of the left biceps compared to the right. The main complaint is profound weakness, particularly with supination, and to a lesser degree with elbow flexion. The patient is unable to lift objects weighing more than 1 pound and cannot flex or supinate the forearm without pain and weakness.

**Past Medical History:**  
No prior history of elbow pain or weakness before the injury.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Obvious deformity of the left biceps with significant proximal retraction and atrophy of the muscle belly relative to the right side.
- Maximum biceps circumference: 32.5 cm in the right arm compared to 29.5 cm in the left arm in the resting position.
- Tenderness over the biceps muscle belly, antecubital fossa, and proximal radius.

**Assessment:**  
Left distal biceps tendon rupture.

**Plan:**  
- Initiate physical therapy to help regain strength and mobility.
- Advise the patient to avoid heavy lifting and repetitive motions that may stress the arm.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.
