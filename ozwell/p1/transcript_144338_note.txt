**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:13:07 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Repeated infection and pain in the right side of the lower jaw for over a year.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic for consultation and treatment due to repeated infection and pain in the right side of the lower jaw. The patient reports experiencing a bad odor and difficulty opening the mouth.

**Examination:**  
- **Oral Examination:** A hard bone-like structure with a rough surface was observed exposed to the oral cavity distal to the right lower second molar. There was plaque accumulation over the mass with a very foul odor and poor oral hygiene.
- **Radiographic Findings:** The ortho-pantomo-graphic x-ray view revealed a calcified mass distal to the right lower second molar, with the third molar on that side displaced distally by the present mass. The calcified mass is encircled inferiorly on its central part by a radiolucent halo, with the inferior dental canal positioned more inferiorly to the lesion. The lower right second molar shows advanced periodontal involvement with bone loss but without any resorption of its distal root.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Calcified mass distal to the right lower second molar with associated periodontal involvement of the second molar.
- **Treatment Plan:** Surgical removal of the calcified mass and disimpaction of the lower right third molar, along with curettage of the infected soft tissues in the area, was proposed. The patient refused the extraction of the lower right second molar. The procedure was carried out under local anesthesia.
- **Postoperative Course:** The healing course postoperatively was uneventful without any neural defect of the related nerves.
- **Histopathological Examination:** Specimens sent for histopathological examination included the soft tissues around the lesion and the hard, calcified lesion. The soft tissue specimen was stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E stain).

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up in a few weeks to check on progress.
