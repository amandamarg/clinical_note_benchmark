**Time:** 8:09:19 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Medical History:** Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, severe psoriasis, history of erysipelas and ulcers on lower extremities.  
- **Surgical History:** Bariatric gastric bypass surgery a few months ago.  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Painful swelling, bruising, and small ulcers on lower extremities post-gastric bypass surgery.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient underwent a bariatric gastric bypass surgical operation a few months ago, having reduced weight from 192 kg to 149 kg prior to the surgery. Postoperatively, the patient received advice from a dietician to maintain a vitamin-rich diet but continued with an insufficient diet to lose more weight. Three months post-surgery, the patient developed painful swelling, bruising, and small ulcers on the lower extremities. One week after these symptoms appeared, the patient was hospitalized with a fever and developed purpura on the lower extremities and a sepsis-like condition within 24 hours. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at Odense University Hospital, intubated, and ventilated. Renal failure was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. The infected leg ulcers were suspected to be the focus for sepsis. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, no bacteria were found in cultures, and there was no improvement on antibiotic therapy. The skin condition worsened, with increasing erythema and ecchymosis forming painful, confluent purpuric plaques and bullae. Minimal trauma to the skin resulted in petechiae and confluent purpuric plaques.
