**Clinical Note:**

**Patient History:**
The patient has a history of a fall from the sixth floor at the age of 4, resulting in a severe traumatic brain injury. During the trauma screening, multiple brain contusions were identified along with an incidental finding of extensive optic glioma.

**Imaging and Findings:**
An MRI of the brain revealed that the optic glioma was very extensive, involving the brain parenchyma, extending from both optic nerves through the optic chiasm and into the entire optic pathways bilaterally. It also extended to the intraventricular system and the sella and suprasellar region.

**Initial Management:**
The patient was treated in the pediatric intensive care unit with conservative treatment for the head injury. The patient's neurological status was poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8/15. Due to the extensive nature of the optic glioma, the pediatric neuro-oncology tumor board determined that no further treatment could be offered.

**Follow-up and Complications:**
During follow-up, the patient exhibited a significant increase in head circumference, reaching up to 74 cm. A repeat brain MRI showed progression of the tumor size and hydrocephalus, leading to the insertion of a VP shunt.

After 4 months, the VP shunt was complicated by recurrent abdominal ascites due to scarring from previous abdominal exploratory surgery and high protein content in the CSF. The patient required multiple revisions and tapping of the abdominal ascites by inserting a peg tail. The management of multiple VP shunt revisions ultimately failed.

**CSF Analysis and Further Management:**
The CSF protein was frequently found to be more than 20 g/L, necessitating frequent periodic ascitic tapping approximately every 3 weeks. Due to the high protein content of the CSF, other cavities for shunt placement were excluded, such as the pleural cavity to avoid pleural effusion and the cardiac atrium to avoid thrombosis. Brain endoscopic surgeries like ETV were also excluded due to the tumor.

**Conclusion:**
The patient's condition is complex, with significant challenges in managing the complications associated with the extensive optic glioma and high protein CSF. Further treatment options are limited due to the nature of the tumor and previous surgical interventions.
