**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mr. X  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mr. X presented with a discharging sinus in the epigastrium. The condition began approximately 12 years after his second mechanical aortic valve replacement surgery. He reports that his GP initially treated the sinus with dressings and antibiotics, but it failed to heal.

**Medical History:**
- Mechanical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis 14 years ago.
- Repeat mechanical aortic valve replacement for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis 2 years after the first surgery.
- Postoperative recovery following the second valve replacement was uneventful, with a well-healed sternal wound for 12 years.

**Objective:**
- Exploration of the sinus under general anesthesia revealed communication with the anterior mediastinum. The sinus was divided at the point of entry into the mediastinum and removed, along with all sternal wires.
- Microbiology of the excised tissue showed staphylococcus aureus infection. Despite 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotic treatment, the wound failed to heal.
- CT scan of the chest showed an encapsulated mass extending from the ascending aorta to the diaphragm and a normal sternum.
- Transthoracic echocardiography ruled out pseudoaneurysm of the ascending aorta, prosthetic endocarditis, and aortic root abscess.
- MR scan confirmed a longitudinal retrosternal mass extending from the mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm with cutaneous fistulization to the epigastrium through the left rectus sheath.

**Assessment:**
The patient has a nonpulsatile longitudinal 15 cm mass on the anterior surface of the ascending aorta and right ventricle, extending along the entire length of the anterior mediastinum. The mass exits the mediastinum at the diaphragm, penetrating the left rectus sheath and communicating with the skin in the epigastrium. A branching tract extends from the main tract to the right and inferiorly over at the junction of the superior 1/3 and inferior 2/3.

**Plan:**
Recommend a secondary median sternotomy to further investigate the cause of the symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. The patient will receive detailed pre-procedure instructions, including medication adjustments and dietary guidelines, during the upcoming appointment.

**Instructions to Patient:**
- Stop taking certain medications as advised.
- Follow a specific diet before the procedure.
- Await further detailed instructions at the next appointment.

**Follow-up:**
Schedule an appointment for pre-procedure instructions and preparation.
