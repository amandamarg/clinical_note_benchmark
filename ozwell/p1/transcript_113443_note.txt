**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:33:58 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Referred by:** Primary Care Physician  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Painful right hip for the past 6 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing localized pain above the right hip joint for the past 6 months. The patient also noted a palpable mass just above the anterior superior iliac spine.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Pelvic X-ray:** Revealed an exostosis overlying the lateral superior border of the right iliac bone.
- **MRI Scan:** Radiological features suggestive of an osteosarcoma.
- **Biopsy and Histopathological Analysis:** Indicated an adenocarcinoma of metastatic origin.
- **Further Staining:** Showed mucin production, positive for cytokeratin 20 and caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2, suggesting a colorectal origin.
- **Staging CT Scan (Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis):** Did not reveal a primary source but identified thickening of the ascending colon.
- **Colonoscopy:** Identified the thickened area as a hepatic flexure adenocarcinoma with mucin production confirmed on histopathological analysis.
- **Comparison with Bone Biopsy Histopathology:** Confirmed the bone lesion as a secondary deposit from the colonic adenocarcinoma.
- **Further Analysis of Colonic Tumor:** No pathogenic mutation in the K-RAS and N-RAS gene.

**Assessment:**  
Unusual presentation of metastatic colonic cancer as a solitary bony lesion mimicking a sarcoma. No other clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic spread to other organs such as the liver, lung, or other bones.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor the patient's progress.
