**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:26:46 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** Diabetes, previous sigmoid resection for diverticulitis, ERCP for choledocholithiasis.

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Cough and diffuse abdominal pain.

**Diagnosis:**  
- Sepsis, acute cholecystitis.

**Investigations:**  
- Blood sample investigation showed mild leucocytosis with PRC augmentation and normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels.
- Preoperative ultrasound revealed a thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
- Retrospective analysis of a previous CT scan was unable to demonstrate the gallbladder's attachment to the left side of the liver due to a hypertrophic left lobe.

**Surgical Findings and Procedure:**  
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed.
- Incidental intraoperative finding of a left-sided gallbladder.
- Careful dissection of Calotâ€™s triangle was performed, identifying and isolating the cystic duct and artery.
- Right-sided positioning of the cystic duct was demonstrated.
- Safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery were achieved, and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag.

**Postoperative Course:**  
- Complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia.
- Conditions were controlled postoperatively in the intensive care unit.
- Patient was discharged on postoperative day 16 in good condition.

**Retrospective Analysis:**  
- Vascular and biliary reconstruction showed evidence of agenesis of the right anterior sector of the liver with the absence of the right hepatic duct.
- Intrahepatic variation with insertion of the right inferior sectorial duct into the left common duct as type A3 of Huang Classification.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring and managing diabetes.
- Follow-up for any further complications or concerns.
