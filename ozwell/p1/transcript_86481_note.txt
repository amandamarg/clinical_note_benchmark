**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:26:34 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain in the right forearm  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred from another center due to persistent pain in the right forearm, which began approximately six and a half months ago. Initially, the pain was mild but has progressively worsened. The patient's parents initially attributed the pain to excessive physical activity, including cycling, and did not seek immediate medical attention. After three and a half months, due to increasing pain, the patient was taken to a local doctor.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Swelling in the right forearm, which has gradually worsened over time.  

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- **X-ray:** Revealed an expansile lytic lesion in the proximal half of the radius. Follow-up X-ray showed an increase in the size of the lesion with cortical thinning.  
- **MRI:** Demonstrated low to intermediate signal intensity with a rim of low signal intensity and internal septa.  
- **Biopsy:** Confirmed the presence of an aneurysmal bone cyst.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has an aneurysmal bone cyst in the right radius, causing pain and swelling. The lesion is expansile with thin cortices, making curettage unfeasible.  

**Plan:**  
- **Surgical Intervention:** A wide resection of the tumor is planned.  
- **Reconstruction Options:**  
  1. Autograft using the patient's own fibula, though concerns exist regarding size mismatch and surgical trauma at two sites.  
  2. Cadaveric allograft.  
  3. Allogenic allograft from the patient's mother.  

The patient's parents have been informed of the options, but expressed reluctance to use the allograft stored in the bank. Further discussion with the parents is necessary to determine the best course of action.  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient and family will be consulted further to finalize the treatment plan. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms or concerns.
