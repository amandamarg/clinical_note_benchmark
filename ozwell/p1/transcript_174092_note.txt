**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Right groin bulge present for 6 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented in the outpatient surgical setting with a chief complaint of a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. The patient experienced sharp pain initially when the abnormality developed but has been asymptomatic since then.

**Physical Examination:**  
On examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpated in the right groin, just lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Imaging and Laboratory Findings:**  
A computed tomography scan was performed, revealing a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac. Preoperative laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 10^9/L.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient was advised to undergo surgical intervention for hernia repair. The patient consented to proceed with the surgery.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
A classic oblique incision was made in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. The hernia was examined and found to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance. The base of the appendix was seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity. Initially, there was no indication to perform an appendectomy if the appendix could be successfully reduced into the abdominal cavity. However, the chronic appearing adhesions in the area prevented this step. A relaxing incision was made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum was entered. No complications occurred during the procedure.

**Postoperative Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks post-surgery. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the recovery process and ensure proper healing.

**Family Discussion:**  
The cause of the hernia is unknown, other than no implantation of mesh occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977. The patient's family was informed about the procedure and postoperative care requirements.
