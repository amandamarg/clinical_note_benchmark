**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:02:29 PM  

**Patient Complaint:**  
The patient reports feeling tired and experiencing shortness of breath for a couple of months, particularly during physical activities. The patient denies any chest pain, heart palpitations, or fainting spells.

**Vital Signs:**  
- Blood Pressure: 148/66 mmHg  
- Pulse: 48 beats per minute  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Heart auscultation revealed an S4 sound.  
- Jugular vein examination showed cannon A waves.  

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- **12-lead Electrocardiogram:** Complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block.  
- **Previous Electrocardiogram (3 months ago):** Underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm.  
- **Trans-thoracic Echocardiography:** Normal heart size and function with mild degenerative changes in the mitral and aortic valves, consistent with age.  
- **Lab Results:** No evidence of metabolic or ischemic problems.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient likely has age-related degenerative conduction disease, given the symptoms, age, and examination results. There is a possibility of coronary artery disease, but it is considered unlikely due to the absence of chest pain and other risk factors.

**Plan:**  
- Recommend implantation of a permanent pacemaker to address symptomatic complete heart block.  
- Post-implantation evaluation for possible coronary artery disease.  
- Informed consent obtained for the procedure.  
- Note: Potential difficulty in delivering the pacemaker lead into the right ventricular cavity due to a persistent left superior vena cava, but alternative access methods will be considered.

**Follow-up:**  
Schedule the pacemaker implantation surgery as soon as possible.
