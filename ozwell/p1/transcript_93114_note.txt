**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- Patient experienced a work accident, falling from a height of 2 meters and landing on the right side.

**Initial Assessment:**
- Patient was conscious and well-orientated upon admission with normal vital signs.
- Complaints of severe pain and swelling in the right shoulder and arm.

**Clinical Examination:**
- Closed and neurovascular intact injury observed.
- Angulation of the arm with loss of the normal contour of the shoulder noted.

**Radiographic Findings:**
- Anterior dislocation of the shoulder.
- Transverse fracture of the middle third of the humeral shaft on the right side.

**Initial Management:**
- Arm temporarily immobilized in a plaster slab.
- MRI not performed due to lack of equipment; clinical examination to determine future need for MRI.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Under general anesthesia, repeated attempts for closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder were unsuccessful due to strong muscle contraction and extensive soft tissue swelling.
- Decision made to avoid further reduction maneuvers to prevent additional soft tissue compromise and iatrogenic neurovascular damage.
- Stabilization of the shaft fracture attempted via intramedullary nailing.
- Entry point targeted on the dislocated humeral head; incision made on overlying skin.
- Anteriorly placed humeral head in subcoracoid space facilitated guide wire and nail insertion.
- Intraoperative investigation revealed no rotator cuff or biceps pathology.
- Typical intramedullary nailing procedure could not be completed due to damage to image intensifier equipment after proximal locking screw insertion.

**Prognosis and Follow-up:**
- Condition to be monitored closely; further surgery may be necessary.
- Prognosis is uncertain at this stage, but with proper care and follow-up, improvement is expected.
- Patient and family informed of the situation and ongoing monitoring plan.
