**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Reason for Visit:**  
Post-transplantation check-up.

**Medical History:**  
- End-stage renal disease secondary to lupus nephritis.
- Bilateral thrombosis of both common and external iliac arteries due to lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies, requiring bilateral percutaneous angioplasty with wall stenting.
- Thrombosis of both iliac veins and the lower portion of the inferior vena cava.
- Extensive atherosclerotic lesions of the abdominal aorta.
- History of mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude prosthetic valve; on anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarol.

**Transplantation Details:**  
- Underwent orthotopic renal transplantation using a kidney from HLA semi-identical sister.
- Donor workup showed a slightly lower tubular mass of the right kidney, which was chosen for procurement.
- "Classic" extraperitoneal pelvic transplantation contraindicated due to stented iliac arteries and extended atheromatosis of the aorta.
- Alternative surgical technique with transplantation of the graft into the location of a native kidney was performed.
- Mapping CT-angiography showed the left renal artery was appropriate for anastomosis with the graft artery.
- Anatomical variant of the left recipient renal vein with low implantation to the inferior vena cava was noted.
- Graft procured by laparoscopic right donor transperitoneal nephrectomy using linear stapler Endo-GIA.
- Warm ischemic time was 3 minutes.
- Graft cold flushed with HTK solution and preserved on ice during the left nephrectomy of the recipient.
- Total duration of donor nephrectomy was 95 minutes with total blood loss of 25 mL.

**Plan:**  
Review test results and follow up with the patient.
