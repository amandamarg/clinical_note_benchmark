**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]
- **Date:** 10/1/2025
- **Time:** 7:34:59 PM

**Chief Complaint:**
- Pain and redness on the right ear.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient presented with a mass on the right ear, which has been present since birth. Recently, the mass has increased slightly in size. The patient denies any history of trauma or other abnormalities.

**Physical Examination:**
- A raised lump was observed on the upper part and back of the right helix, measuring approximately 2x2 cm. The surface of the skin on the mass appeared normal, with slight redness. No skin findings of fistula or skin adhesions were observed.

**Surgical Procedure:**
- Surgery was performed under general anesthesia. An incision was made parallel to the auricle and the longitudinal axis of the mass at the back of the helix. Minimal adhesion of the helix cartilage to surrounding tissues was noted, allowing easy elevation of the skin covering the mass. The helix cartilage on the mass was removed easily. An unusual depression on the helix cartilage was noted. The mass was encapsulated and cystic, with cheese-like sebum observed during dissection.

**Histological Examination:**
- The encapsulated film was composed of stratified squamous epithelium. The inside of the cyst was composed of a keratinous cyst with laminated keratin material. No adnexal structures of skin, such as hair and sweat glands, were present. Invasion of acute and chronic inflammatory cells around the mass was observed.

**Diagnosis:**
- The mass was diagnosed as an epidermoid cyst.

**Post-Surgical Follow-Up:**
- Three months post-surgery, no complications such as inflammation were observed. Approximately one year post-surgery, two masses were observed at the top of the ipsilateral helix. These masses were removed, and histologic examination showed the same results as the previous year. The first mass was diagnosed as a congenital epidermoid cyst, and the second was diagnosed similarly.

**Recommendations:**
- Regular check-ups are recommended to monitor the condition.
