**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain in the right knee.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports pain over the medial aspect of the right knee, which is non-radiating. The pain is relieved by rest but exacerbated by squatting and sitting cross-legged. The patient also experiences difficulty climbing stairs. There is no history of recent trauma to the knee joint.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Patella fracture 4 years ago, treated by open reduction and internal fixation.  
- Implant removal 2 years ago.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Tenderness along the medial aspect of the knee joint.  
- Curved scar mark present over the anterior aspect of the knee joint.  
- Full range of motion at the knee joint.  
- Moderate pain on the medial side during flexion and extension of the knee joint.  
- No distal neurovascular deficit observed.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
Weight-bearing standing antero-posterior and lateral x-rays of the left knee joint revealed multiple pieces of broken circlage wire around the knee joint, with one piece migrated posteriorly.

**Assessment:**  
Provisional diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee joint. The pain is attributed to degenerative changes in the knee joint rather than the broken hardware.

**Plan:**  
- Advised total knee replacement along with subsequent removal of broken hardware due to potential complications from the broken hardware, such as damage to neurovascular structures or migration of pieces causing life-threatening complications.  
- Patient refused surgery.  
- Advised the patient to be alert for any changes in the nature of the pain.

**Follow-up:**  
Monitor for changes in symptoms and reconsider surgical options if necessary.
