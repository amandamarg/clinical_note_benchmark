**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:30:27 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis  
- **History:** The patient presented approximately 10 months ago with pain and swelling in the right arm. A CT scan of the neck with contrast revealed masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions. The patient has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, experiencing thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate.  

**Current Presentation:**  
- **Pain:** Constant 10/10 pain in the right proximal humerus, right anterior and posterior shoulder, and right supraclavicular region. The pain is described as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature, worsened by passive and active range of motion.  
- **Weakness:** Progressive worsening in the entire right upper extremity.  

**Recent Evaluations:**  
- **MRI of the Brachial Plexus:** Revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus.  
- **Diagnostic Brachial Plexus Block:** Attempted due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. The brachial plexus was unable to be visualized using ultrasonography in the classic supraclavicular area due to the tumor effect.  

**Pain Management:**  
- The patient was referred to the pain clinic for further management of intractable pain.  
- Current medications include extended release morphine, immediate release morphine, methadone, and gabapentin. Pain control remains suboptimal.  

**Management Plan:**  
- Continue titration of oral medications.  
- Discuss interventional pain management techniques, such as nerve blocks or spinal cord stimulation.  

**Outcome:**  
Despite best efforts, the patient eventually passed away due to complications of metastatic disease progression. Pain management and comfort were prioritized in the patient's final days.  

**Family Communication:**  
The family has been informed of the patient's passing. Our thoughts are with them during this difficult time.
