Worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis for the past 2-3 days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis over the past 2-3 days. The patient also reported hoarseness over the past year and was previously diagnosed with left vocal cord palsy following a direct laryngoscopy. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mediastinal mass, and a direct needle biopsy demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Mild stroke 6 years ago, no sequelae reported.

**Vital Signs on Admission:**  
- Pulse rate: 86 beats per minute  
- Respiratory rate: 18 per minute  
- Blood pressure: 135/80 mm Hg  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Continuous murmur in the left sternal and pulmonic area.  
- Decreased breath sounds in the left hemithorax.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Chest X-ray: Large density in the mediastinum and left-sided pleural effusion.  
- Echocardiography: Normal left ventricle, dilated right-sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis.  
- Trans-esophageal echocardiography: Pseudoaneurysm of the distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery.  
- Chest CT scan with contrast and angiographic construction: Confirmed a 45 mm by 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in the lateral side of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian origin with an associated 9.5 cm by 10 cm hematoma in the mediastinum.

**Social History:**  
- The patient recalled falling down a few stairs 10 years ago but did not seek medical advice at the time.

**Surgical History:**  
- Initially refused operation but later developed severe chest pain and agreed to a surgical plan.  
- Preoperative selective coronary angiography via the right radial artery was normal.  
- Underwent left thoracotomy via femorofemoral bypass.  
- A large pseudoaneurysm of the distal aortic arch was detected during surgery.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor the patient's progress post-surgery.
