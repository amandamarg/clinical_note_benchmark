**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient presents with symptoms consistent with complications from cancer of the floor of the mouth and recent radiotherapy. The burning sensation, difficulty swallowing, and ulceration are likely exacerbated by the recent radiotherapy.

Continue current pain management regimen and consider additional supportive care for oral intake and mental health support. Follow-up with oncology and pain management teams is necessary.
