**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:25:59 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Fractured crown in relation to root canal treated maxillary left central incisor.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports having undergone root canal treatment of the maxillary left central incisor three years ago, followed by the placement of a fixed bridge prosthesis in the bilateral maxillary central incisor regions. Recently, the prosthesis became avulsed, and the crown portion of the maxillary left central incisor fractured after biting into a hard food substance. The patient expressed dissatisfaction with the previous dental treatment, citing unsatisfactory esthetic and functional outcomes of the prosthesis, and now requests a single crown prosthesis. The previous bridge prosthesis failed to simulate the natural tooth appearance.

**Medical and Dental History:**  
- No other relevant dental and medical histories reported.  
- Family history is non-contributory.  
- The patient is a teetotaler.  

**Examination:**  
- Oral hygiene is satisfactory.  
- The gingival and periodontal status of the teeth appears healthy.  
- The right maxillary central incisor had undergone tooth preparation as part of the previous bridge prosthesis.

**Treatment Plan:**  
After considering the esthetic and functional demands in the anterior esthetic region and the patient's request for an implant-based fixed prosthetic rehabilitation, the plan is to extract the fractured, root canal treated maxillary left central incisor and immediately place an implant. The patient will be provided with information on various treatment modalities, including the advantages, disadvantages, and cost factors related to each therapeutic mode.

**Consent:**  
The patient will provide written informed consent prior to the surgical procedure.

**Anesthesia:**  
The surgical site will be anesthetized by local administration of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride to ensure the patient does not experience pain during the procedure.
