**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** 13-year-old male

**Chief Complaint:** Left hip pain and inability to bear weight following a fall while skiing.

**History of Present Illness:** The patient is a 13-year-old male who presented with left hip pain and inability to bear weight after a skiing accident. The patient was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon and diagnosed with an unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The patient underwent surgery for percutaneous in-situ fixation, which was uncomplicated with appropriate center-center positioning of the screw within the head and epiphysis. The patient returned home with family and followed up with a local orthopedic surgeon. At 3 weeks post-operation, the patient developed recurrent pain and difficulty in weight-bearing. New X-rays demonstrated failure of the hardware with progression of the SCFE displacement and a Grade 3 slip angle measured at 60 degrees. The patient was taken back to surgery for hardware removal and revision closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the SCFE. Surgical dislocation of the hip with hardware removal, open reduction, and pinning was also listed on the consent if the closed procedure failed. In-situ pinning and remodeling was deemed unlikely to have a successful outcome due to less than 3 years remaining until the patient turned 16 and having already achieved nearly the same height as the father and skeletally mature older brother.

**Surgical Procedure:** The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on a fracture table in the supine position. Under fluoroscopic guidance, minimal traction was applied to the left leg through the boot harness, and the leg was internally rotated so that on both AP and lateral images, the long axis of the screw shaft and the distal screw fragment within the epiphysis were co-axial. A guide wire was then threaded back through the screw, allowing the cannulated screwdriver to be easily seated within the screw head, and the proximal screw fragment was removed.

**Current Status:** The patient reports still experiencing some pain, but it is slightly improved.

**Plan:** Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress.
