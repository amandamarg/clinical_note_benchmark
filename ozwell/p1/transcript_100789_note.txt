**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:25:09 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI):** 28.5 m2/kg  
- **Medical History:** End-stage renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis  

**Procedure:** Kidney Transplant  

**Donor Information:**  
- **Type of Donation:** Donation after brain death  
- **Cause of Donor Death:** Intracerebral haemorrhage  

**Donor Kidney Details:**  
- **Renal Artery:** Single renal artery with a patch  
- **Ureter:** Single ureter  
- **Veins:** Main hilar renal vein diameter 12 mm, lower polar vein diameter 8 mm, separated by a distance of 4 cm  
- **Vein Division:** Divided at the level of the inferior vena cava, no caval tube provided  

**Transplant Details:**  
- **Implantation Site:** Right iliac fossa  
- **Anastomosis:**  
  - Main hilar renal vein anastomosed end to side to the external iliac vein using 5/0 polypropylene  
  - Renal arterial patch anastomosed end to side to the external iliac artery using 5/0 polypropylene  
  - Lower polar vein initially controlled with a fine atraumatic vascular clamp, not anastomosed initially  

**Intraoperative Findings:**  
- On release of arterial and venous clamps, kidney appeared globally well perfused with some urine production observed  
- Both main hilar and lower polar veins distended and felt congested  
- On-table Doppler ultrasound confirmed global perfusion but showed reversal of flow in diastole throughout the kidney  

**Intervention:**  
- External iliac vein clamped inferior to the upper renal vein anastomosis and at the inguinal ligament  
- Lower polar vein anastomosed end to side to the external iliac vein using 5/0 prolene  

**Post-Intervention Findings:**  
- On clamp release, kidney's appearance improved immediately, both renal veins became soft and easily compressible  
- Repeat intraoperative Doppler ultrasound demonstrated excellent perfusion of the whole kidney and a triphasic waveform with forward flow in diastole  
- Findings confirmed in the recovery room by an experienced radiologist  

**Conclusion:**  
The patient is doing well after the transplant. Further monitoring and follow-up will be conducted to ensure continued recovery and function of the transplanted kidney.
