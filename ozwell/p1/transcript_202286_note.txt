**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:37:19 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain in right shoulder and chest  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with severe pain in the right shoulder and chest following a one-rep max bench press, during which they felt a pop in the right upper arm. The patient denies any history of anabolic steroid use. Initial treatment included ice application and a sling provided by the trainer, followed by an evaluation in the emergency department. X-rays were negative for fracture or dislocation, and the patient was neurovascularly intact. The patient was discharged with a sling.

The following day, the patient presented to the orthopedic clinic with significant swelling and bruising in the right upper arm and chest, a bulge in the anterior chest area, and loss of contour in the axillary fold. The patient denied any numbness or paresthesia and had full range of motion in the elbow, wrist, and fingers. Sensory response was intact, and the radial pulse was 2+.

An MRI was scheduled, revealing avulsion of the pectoralis major tendon from its insertion on the humerus with retraction and strain of the anterior deltoid. Surgery was scheduled for five days later. The patient was prescribed oxycodone and valium for pain management.

Two days post-initial evaluation, the patient returned with severe worsening pain in the right upper arm. Compartment syndrome was confirmed with intracompartmental pressure readings in the anterior compartment of the arm, necessitating an emergency fasciotomy.

**Medications:**  
- Oxycodone  
- Valium  

**Plan:**  
- Proceed with scheduled surgery for pectoralis major tendon repair.  
- Monitor post-operative recovery and manage pain.  
- Follow-up appointments to assess healing and rehabilitation progress.  

**Family Communication:**  
The patient's family was informed about the emergency fasciotomy following the confirmation of compartment syndrome. Further updates will be provided post-surgery.
