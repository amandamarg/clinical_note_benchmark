**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with complaints of non-specific periumbilical pain and nausea. The patient denied experiencing vomiting, changes in bowel habits, weight loss, fever, or a history of similar pain episodes. The patient is otherwise healthy with no previous abdominal surgeries.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed mild lower abdominal tenderness with no clinically palpable mass. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast showed a heterogeneous appearing mass-like lesion in the midline of the pelvis measuring 11.4 × 6.8 × 6.6 cm, with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity. The mass was intimately associated with multiple segments of small bowel in the lower abdomen, with no associated bowel obstruction. The initial radiologist impression suggested a possible gastrointestinal stromal tumor. A CT scan of the chest showed no evidence of metastatic disease in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The case was discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards, and the consensus was to proceed with surgical resection of the primary tumor. The patient was taken to the operating room for a diagnostic laparoscopy, laparotomy, and resection of the mass. During laparoscopic exploration, no liver metastases or peritoneal deposits were identified. The mass occupied the middle portion of the lower abdominal cavity. Due to concerns of disrupting the integrity of the tumor during laparoscopic dissection given its large size and weight, the procedure was converted to an open procedure. The mass was connected to the greater omentum with a vascular pedicle and slightly adherent to epiploic appendages of the sigmoid colon. An intraoperative flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed and was unremarkable. The mass was not invading any intra-abdominal structures, and there was no evidence of metastatic disease. It was resected en bloc with an adequate margin on the omental pedicle. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day three.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to follow up as required.
