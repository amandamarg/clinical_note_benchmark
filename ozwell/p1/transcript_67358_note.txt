**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:06:41 PM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Lightheadedness, excessive sweating, episodes of losing consciousness, right foot tingling, and blurry vision.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing excessive sweating for the past two weeks, along with two episodes of losing consciousness. Two weeks ago, the patient presented to the emergency room with sudden difficulty moving the right side and speaking. Evaluation for a stroke was conducted, but tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was not administered due to delayed presentation. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck revealed a blockage in the right vertebral artery, severe narrowing in the left vertebral artery, and a blood clot in the right vertebral artery partially blocking the basilar artery. The patient was then transported to our Comprehensive Stroke Center for specialized treatment. The patient regained full strength and speech, which appeared to be largely dependent on blood pressure. Currently, the patient reports tingling in the right foot and blurry vision, with symptoms worsening upon changing positions.

**Tests and Results:**  
- **CTA (Emergency Room):** Blockage in the right vertebral artery, severe narrowing in the left vertebral artery, and a blood clot in the right vertebral artery partially blocking the basilar artery.
- **Cerebral Digital Subtraction Angiogram (DSA) (Comprehensive Stroke Center):** Recent blockage in the right vertebral artery likely related to severe narrowing near the dural ring, severe narrowing in the left vertebral artery, unstable blood clot at the vertebrobasilar junction, and a strange shape of the mid-basilar artery.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient will be started on antiplatelet therapy and heparin for several days to address the unstable blood clot. The goal is to stabilize the condition to allow for the placement of a stent in the left vertebral artery. The patient has been advised to follow instructions and return if any concerns arise.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is instructed to monitor symptoms and return for follow-up as needed. No further questions were raised by the patient regarding the treatment plan.
