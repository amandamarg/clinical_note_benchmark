**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Susan [Last Name]

**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Subjective:**
Susan reports worsening pain and difficulty with daily activities. She has a history of scoliosis and underwent carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand during her time as a hairstylist. Despite the surgery, her symptoms returned, and she has experienced severe pain since. She has tried various treatments, including chiropractors, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, but none have provided relief. Certain yoga movements and swimming strokes exacerbate her pain.

In her early forties, Susan began experiencing weakness in her lower body, with her legs giving out on stairs and a loss of bladder and bowel control. An MRI led to emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. Unfortunately, the surgery resulted in paralysis on her right side, requiring an 8-week hospital stay for rehabilitation to regain the ability to walk. A subsequent surgery for pain relief worsened her condition. She currently receives weekly injections for pain relief, which only marginally decrease her pain for about one week. She also reports heightened sensitivity in her legs, where even a bed sheet can cause pain.

**Objective:**
- History of scoliosis
- Previous carpal tunnel surgery on the right hand
- Cervical spine surgery with post-operative complications
- Current treatment includes weekly pain relief injections

**Assessment:**
Susan presents with a complex history of spinal issues, post-surgical complications, and chronic pain. Her symptoms suggest ongoing spinal cord issues and neuropathic pain, possibly related to previous surgeries and underlying conditions.

**Plan:**
- Schedule follow-up tests to further evaluate her condition and explore alternative treatment options.
- Continue current pain management regimen while exploring additional therapies.
- Monitor for any changes in symptoms or new developments.

**Follow-up:**
Susan will be contacted to arrange the necessary tests and discuss potential adjustments to her treatment plan. She is encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
