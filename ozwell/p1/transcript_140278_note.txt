**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:16:59 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe pain in left mandibular first molar and numbness in left lower lip and chin.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to our department for evaluation of severe pain in the left mandibular first molar and numbness in the left lower lip and chin. Approximately one week ago, the patient underwent endodontic treatment initiated by a general dentist for a carious exposure in the left mandibular first molar. The day following the procedure, the patient developed severe pain in the same tooth and numbness in the left lower lip and chin. The patient's dentist prescribed a combination of ofloxacin 200 mg and ornidazole 500 mg every 12 hours, along with aceclofenac potassium 100 mg and paracetamol 500 mg every 12 hours. The medication provided pain relief but did not improve the numbness.

**Examination:**  
- **Sensory Response:** No deviation in sensory response of gingiva and tongue on probing. The numbness extends from the mandibular midline to the left second premolar both intraorally and extraorally.
- **Left Mandibular First Molar:** Unremoved proximal carious lesion and a temporary restoration placed in the access cavity with the tooth in occlusion.
- **Radiographic Findings:** Intra-oral periapical radiograph reveals apical periodontal ligament widening in relation to both mesial and distal roots and slight apical root resorption in the distal root.

**Diagnosis:**  
Acute apical periodontitis with mental nerve paresthesia.

**Treatment Plan:**  
With the patient's written informed consent, it was decided to continue the endodontic treatment along with conservative management of the paresthesia. The treatment will involve administering local anesthesia via an inferior alveolar nerve block and isolating the involved tooth with a rubber dam. The temporary restoration will be removed, and the access cavity will be prepared in a normal fashion. There is no active discharge from the canals.

**Patient Consent:**  
The patient has signed the informed consent form and is ready to proceed with the treatment.
