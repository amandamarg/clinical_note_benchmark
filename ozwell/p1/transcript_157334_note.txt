**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:14:14 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden headache and mental deterioration.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the emergency center with a sudden onset of a sharp, severe headache that began this morning. The patient also reported feeling drowsy and experiencing difficulty thinking clearly. On admission, the patient was drowsy with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, indicating drowsiness but the ability to respond to stimuli. No focal neurologic signs were detected.

**Medical History:**  
- No history of diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, or hepatitis.  

**Family History:**  
- Mother suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage.  

**Diagnostic Imaging and Procedures:**  
- Brain computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography on admission revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) with hydrocephalus, and a tortuous vascular structure around the brain stem and upper cervical spinal cord.
- Cerebral angiography, performed after stabilization and headache control, showed multiple vascular structures around the left vertebral artery connected to the drained vein observed via the left vertebral artery angiogram.

**Interventions:**  
- Attempted embolization on the left occipital artery and the distal V2 segment of the left vertebral artery was halted due to reflux.
- Another embolization was performed from the V4 and V3 segment to some of the distal V2 segment of the left vertebral artery, terminated after partial occlusion was identified.

**Post-Intervention Course:**  
- Developed mental deterioration and left hemiplegia post-embolization. Cerebral angiography and brain CT showed no new lesions such as cerebral hemorrhages or occlusions.
- One week post-embolization, follow-up brain CT showed subacute cerebral infarction on the left cerebellum and thalamus, with a mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle and brain stem.

**Current Status:**  
- Transferred to the department of rehabilitation medicine.
- Patient remains drowsy with a GCS score of 14.
- Manual muscle tests of the left upper and lower extremities were performed.

**Plan:**  
- Follow-up visit scheduled in one week to monitor progress.
