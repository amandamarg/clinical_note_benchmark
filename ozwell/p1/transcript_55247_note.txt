**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe right thigh pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe pain in the right thigh following a recent road traffic accident where they fell off a motorcycle. The patient has a history of a previous road traffic accident two years ago, which resulted in a fracture of the right femur treated with intramedullary nailing.

**Physical Examination:**  
- The patient describes the pain as sharp and reports difficulty moving the right leg.
- No open wound observed on the right thigh.

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- 30° varus angulation of the femoral nail in the AP view.
- 30° anterior angulation in the lateral view.
- Continuity of the nail intact.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Decision made to remove the nail surgically.
- Surgery performed under spinal anaesthesia with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position.
- A skin incision was made using a lateral approach at the fracture site under image intensifier guidance.
- Tissue was divided layer by layer until the fracture site was reached, and fibrous tissue around it was cleared.

**Surgical Techniques Attempted:**  
1. Initial technique: Partially weakening the nail followed by manual straightening. The bent nail was partially resected using a jumbo cutter through the wound. Reduction was attempted using bone holder forceps placed at the proximal and distal part of the fracture site, applying strength to straighten the bent nail. This correction failed.
2. Second technique: Fully cutting the nail and extracting it into two different pieces. The distal locking screw was removed, followed by the removal of the proximal locking screw. Manual traction was applied as a distraction at the fracture site to fully visualize the apex of angulation of the bent nail. A jumbo cutter was introduced up to the visible nail and sectioned by multiple bites into two parts.

**Post-Operative Care:**  
- Continuous saline was used to flush the wound.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up visit in a week to check on the wound and assess healing progress.
