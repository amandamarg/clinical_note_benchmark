**Subjective:**  
Mr. [Patient's Name] presented today for evaluation and management of long-term dialysis access. The patient has been on hemodialysis for several years and currently has a catheter in the left femoral vein. He reported a history of lung empyema a month ago, for which he is still undergoing drainage and antibiotic treatment. The patient has had multiple arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in both upper extremities, which have previously failed.

**Objective:**  
Due to the history of empyema, which increases the risk of infection in arteriovenous grafts (AVG), the decision was made to implant an AVF in the upper extremity again. Ultrasound mapping was performed in the operating room without tourniquet application to examine the basilic and brachial veins in both limbs. The basilic vein was found to be thrombosed previously. In the left upper limb, the brachial veins were open, with the medial vein measuring 3 mm and joining the axillary vein in the higher part of the upper arm. The paired brachial vein diameter was also 3 mm.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
Based on the ultrasound findings, the plan was to transpose the left medial brachial vein. The surgery was performed under local anesthesia with sedation, utilizing three skip incisions in the medial arm. Initially, a 4-cm horizontal skin incision was made distally in the arm to explore the brachial artery and vein. Lateral branches were identified and separated along the brachial vein, and connections between the two brachial veins were divided by simple sutures. The main difficulty encountered was obtaining proper exposure due to the restricted incision, which was resolved by cutting the brachial vein in the cubital part and changing its direction in different views.

In the second stage, another 4-cm incision was made horizontally in the middle of the arm. The lateral branches of the brachial vein were carefully explored and separated from the lateral incisions at intervals between skin incisions. Finally, by incision of the skin across the hairline in the axillary area, the brachial vein was explored and released from the elbow level. The vein was transposed anteriorly in a superficial tunnel and re-anastomosed higher up.

**Follow-Up:**  
Mr. [Patient's Name] is scheduled to return in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess the healing of the incision. No additional concerns were raised by the patient during today's visit.
