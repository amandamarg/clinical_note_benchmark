**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Gravida 1, Para 2
- History of five attempts of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and hormonal therapy

**Presenting Complaint:**
- Swelling and mass on the right leg

**History of Present Illness:**
- Swelling first noticed during the 5th month of pregnancy
- No pathological findings during pregnancy
- No family history of malignant tumors
- Initial consultation with GP in the 6th month; sonography performed and MRI scan advised
- MRI on 11th July 2012 showed a hyperintense mass of 6.7 cm x 4.7 cm x 3.8 cm surrounding the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle
- X-ray of the knee was normal

**Clinical Examination:**
- Firm mass at the lateral back of the right leg, 10 cm in length from the popliteal fossa to distal, adherent to underlying muscles
- Knee flexion limited to 100Â°
- Peripheral blood circulation and sensibility intact
- Occasional electric paresthesias radiating from the knee along the lateral leg to the foot

**Diagnosis and Plan:**
- Based on anamneses, clinical examination, MRI diagnostic, and differential diagnosis, an open biopsy was recommended due to the close anatomic relation to the tibial and common peroneal nerve, which could cause complications with a fine needle biopsy
- Decision to observe the tumor and perform the open biopsy one week after delivery

**Delivery:**
- Secondary caesarean section on 9th August 2012

**Biopsy:**
- Performed in a face-down position using a posterior approach to the knee
- Common peroneal nerve was surrounded by the superficial

**Outcome:**
- Biopsy revealed the mass was malignant and had spread too far for treatment

**Follow-up:**
- Scheduled follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor the situation and determine if further treatment is needed

**Additional Notes:**
- Patient advised to contact the clinic with any concerns or questions in the meantime.
