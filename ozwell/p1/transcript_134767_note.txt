**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing gastric symptoms for the past few months. They were scheduled for an upper GIT endoscopy. One day prior to the procedure, the patient began experiencing right costal pain, which worsened the following morning. Initially, these symptoms were attributed to anxiety related to the planned procedure. However, within a few days, the patient developed severe localized pain in the right costal area, radiating from the spine forward to the mid-abdomen. The patient also noticed a mild change in skin color in the affected area, with redness, a small vesicular rash, and soreness, which gradually improved with symptomatic treatment for herpes zoster. By the end of the second week, the patient reported heaviness in the right leg and numbness in the left leg. The patient did not experience any urinary symptoms or fever.

**Objective:**  
During the clinical examination conducted three weeks from the onset of neurological symptoms, the patient was found to have an average weight and height, and an abnormal gait. Neurological examination revealed abnormalities confined to the central nervous system, including flaccid right lower limb weakness, brisk knee and ankle jerks on the right, and an unobtainable right plantar reflex. Sensory examination showed normal pinprick, vibration, position, and temperature sensations in the right lower limb. However, pain and temperature sensations were impaired in the left lower limb, which had normal power.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was diagnosed with herpes zoster-induced autoimmune myelitis.

**Plan:**  
The patient was started on IV methyl prednisolone injections, 1 g daily for 3 days, followed by a 4-week course of oral steroids starting at 45 mg/d. A non-contrast dorsal MRI was performed and found to be normal. The patient declined the LP procedure. At the 3-month assessment, the patient's motor weakness had improved, with minimal remaining sensory abnormalities in the left lower limb and no motor weakness in the right lower limb. The patient is feeling much better and a follow-up appointment is scheduled for next month to monitor progress.
