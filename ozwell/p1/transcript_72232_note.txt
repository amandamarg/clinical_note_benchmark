**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:55:46 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Referred by:** [Referring Physician's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Recurrent knee pain  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a history of recurrent attacks of pain in both knees over the past year. Initially, the patient experienced severe pain over the medial aspect of the left knee, which lasted for two weeks and was exacerbated by weight-bearing activities. There was no history of trauma prior to the onset of pain. An MRI of the left knee revealed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema/contusion involving the medial femoral condyle, predominantly along the articular surface. The patient was treated with diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily and advised to avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities, resulting in resolution of the pain over the following weeks.

Three months later, the patient developed spontaneous new onset of pain involving the lateral aspect of the left knee. An MRI showed bone marrow edema involving the lateral femoral condyle, with complete resolution of the previous medial femoral condyle edema. Conservative treatment with NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and use of a cane was advised.

In April of this year, the patient developed gradual pain over the medial side of the right knee, with no obvious swelling. An MRI of the right knee showed a moderate-sized focal area of marrow edema involving the medial tibial plateau medially and anteriorly. The patient was treated similarly to previous episodes. Four months later, the pain became more severe, and a subsequent MRI showed extensive marrow edema involving the medial femoral condyle, with complete recovery of the medial tibial plateau bone marrow edema noted in the previous MRI.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Severe tenderness over the medial side of the left knee  
- Mild effusion  
- Moderate limitation of range of motion  
- No erythema or increased warmth of the knee  

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient is referred to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment. In the meantime, the patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications and to avoid any weight-bearing activities that may exacerbate the condition.

**Medications:**  
- Diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice daily  

**Instructions:**  
- Avoid prolonged weight-bearing activities  
- Continue with NSAIDs and physiotherapy  
- Use a cane to minimize weight bearing on the affected knee  

**Follow-up:**  
Awaiting evaluation by an orthopedic specialist.
