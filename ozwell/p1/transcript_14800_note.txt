**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:11 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Motor vehicle collision  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and was ejected from the vehicle while positioned in the middle of the backseat. The injury occurred approximately 1 hour prior to presentation at the hospital. Field responders placed the patient on a backboard and a cervical collar and resuscitated with intravenous fluids during transport. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection due to a low Glasgow Coma Scale. The patient sustained facial lacerations and closed head trauma.  

**Imaging and Findings:**  
- CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a dislocated left hip with the femoral head displaced into the intrapelvic space, compressing the urethra. A small bony fragment was noted, indicating a minor acetabulum fracture, with no evidence of proximal femur fracture.  
- The patient was in critical condition due to subdural hemorrhage and was taken emergently to the operating room for a craniotomy performed by the neurosurgical team.  
- Post-craniotomy, the orthopedic team evaluated the patient. The physical exam showed gross deformity of bilateral lower extremities with both legs externally rotated and shortened. Crepitus at the distal femur on the right thigh suggested a distal femur fracture.  
- Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging confirmed a right distal femur fracture and left hip dislocation.  

**Interventions:**  
After clearance from the trauma surgery and neurosurgery teams, an emergent closed reduction of the left hip under general anesthesia was performed due to the intrapelvic dislocation of the femoral head. Open reduction was discussed as a potential necessity given the significant displacement of the femoral head.  

**Plan:**  
The patient will have a follow-up appointment scheduled in a few days. It is crucial for the patient to adhere to all instructions from the surgery and neurosurgery teams.
