**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:38:02 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, secondary severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and permanent atrial fibrillation.  
- **Previous Interventions:** ICD implant for primary prevention 5 years ago.  
- **Recent Hospitalizations:** Multiple admissions for acute heart failure, including a recent emergency department visit and subsequent hospitalization.  

**Current Symptoms:**  
- Shortness of breath  
- Peripheral edema  
- Increasing abdominal size  

**Recent Complications:**  
- Infectious complications during hospitalization, contributing to slow resolution of acute heart failure. Required inotropic and vasopressor support.  

**Transfer:**  
- Referred and transferred to advanced heart failure center due to advanced heart failure.  

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **ECG:** Ventricular paced rhythm with RBBB pattern in V1 through V5 leads, extreme right axis displacement of mean QRS in the frontal plane, raising suspicion of ICD lead malposition.  
- **Chest Radiography:** Abnormal lead path suggestive of lead implantation in the left ventricle.  
- **Transthoracic Echocardiogram:** Biventricular dilatation with moderate systolic dysfunction, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, signs of right ventricular pressure overload with plethoric inferior vena cava, and abnormal septal motion with systolic “flattening” toward the left ventricle. The ICD lead appeared to pass through the interatrial septum, with its tip in contact with the midsegment of the left ventricular anterolateral wall.  
- **Transesophageal Echocardiogram:** Performed to clarify valvular regurgitations and behavior of the ICD lead at the interatrial septum.  

**Plan:**  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss test results and treatment plan with the patient and family.
