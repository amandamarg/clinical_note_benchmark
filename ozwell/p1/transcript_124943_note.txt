**Time:** 7:17:57 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [MRN]  
**Age:** [Patient's Age]  
**Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient reports having trouble breathing for several years, which has been worsening over time.

**Medical History:**  
- Spina bifida  
- Hydrocephalus  
- Previous VA shunt placement in early 20s, later replaced with a VP shunt  

**Current Findings:**  
- Echocardiogram: Heart is the right size with normal systolic function. However, there is an issue with the pulmonic valve due to the migration of the VA shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery, causing severe pulmonic insufficiency.  
- Color Doppler and continuous wave Doppler assessment: Large regurgitant jet size with a vena contracta jet width to transpulmonary annulus ratio of 64%.  
- Stress echocardiogram: Patient tolerated only 3 minutes of exercise on a standard Bruce protocol. Peak heart rate was 210 bpm (124% of maximum predicted heart rate), limited by exertional dyspnea. No ischemia detected due to not reaching maximum capacity, and no segmental wall motion abnormalities observed.  

**Previous Tests:**  
- Outpatient pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging test: Revealed moderate ischemia and scarring of the apical anterior and apical walls.  
- Coronary angiography: No obstructive coronary artery disease, but identified migrated VA shunt catheter in the pulmonary artery.  
- Computed tomography scan of the chest with contrast: Negative for pulmonary embolism, showed retained catheter coiling in the main pulmonary artery.  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The migrated VA shunt catheter in the pulmonary artery is causing severe pulmonic insufficiency.  
- Multidisciplinary team discussion concluded that endovascular removal of the catheter is too risky.  
- The recommended course of action is open surgical intracardiac catheter removal and repair.  
- Further discussion with the team is necessary to schedule the procedure.  
- The patient will be monitored closely, and efforts will be made to ensure comfort in the meantime.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- Discuss surgical scheduling with the multidisciplinary team.  
- Continue monitoring the patient's condition and manage symptoms as needed.
