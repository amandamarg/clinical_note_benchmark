**Physical Examination:**
- The patient is hemodynamically unstable.
- Right hip and knee are in a flexed and adducted position.
- Right knee is flexed to 30° with a posterior dislocation.
- Neurovascular examination reveals common peroneal nerve palsy and absent distal pulses.
- Doppler ultrasound shows weak signals over the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.
- Toes are warm with delayed capillary filling.

**Imaging:**
- CT brain: Acute hemorrhagic contusion.
- Radiographs: Posterior dislocation of the right hip and knee, comminuted fracture of the right distal tibia.

**Procedures:**
- Intubation and stabilization.
- Closed reduction attempted:
  - Ankle spanning external fixator applied to address distal tibial fracture.
  - Knee dislocation reduced by gentle traction.
  - Right hip dislocation reduced by traction with hip in 90° flexion and pelvis stabilization.
  - Hip dislocation stable post-reduction.
  - Ankle spanning external fixator extended to span the knee.

**Post-Procedure Findings:**
- Distal pulses not palpable immediately post-procedure, but Doppler shows relatively good flow in posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.
- Foot remains warm with good capillary filling of toes.

**Intensive Care Unit Course:**
- Continued ventilator support for 48 hours.
- Right lower limb vascularity monitored using Doppler.
- Post-reduction CT of the pelvis shows minor posterior wall fracture with congestion.

**Plan:**
- The patient is advised to rest and follow instructions provided by the Intensive Care Unit.
- Regular monitoring and check-ups will be conducted to assess the patient's condition.
