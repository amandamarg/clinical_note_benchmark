**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- **Condition:** End-stage renal disease due to diabetes and cardiovascular disease
- **History:** Multiple emergency room admissions for intermittent dialysis

**Chief Complaint:**
- Shortness of breath

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He has been admitted to the emergency room multiple times for intermittent dialysis when symptoms met criteria for emergent dialysis. During the current presentation for emergent dialysis, the patient suffered a cardiac event and was intubated for a cardiac catheterization. During extubation, a clinician noted marked prominence of the palate and mucosal ulceration. The patient reported a bulky hard mass on the palate that had been present for several years, growing slowly over time. He also noted progressive swelling and disfigurement of the face and a hard mass along the mandible, which had also grown over time. The patient did not experience any pain associated with these changes and had not sought further evaluation due to lack of insurance.

**Consultations and Imaging:**
Oral maxillary surgery was consulted, and a CT maxillary face was performed. The CT scan revealed severe enlargement of the maxilla and mandible with a coarse, marbled appearance of the bony matrix, seen as alternating wavy bands of lucency and sclerosis. The bony expansion was most prominent at the maxilla and mandible, with a bulky expanded hard palate accounting for the mass seen during extubation. Abnormal bony changes were also noted in other bones of the face, though less prominent, at the skull base.

**Laboratory Findings:**
The patient has a long history of significantly elevated creatinine levels, up to 17.5 mg/dL, and low glomerular filtration.

**Plan:**
Based on the patient's history, imaging results, and current presentation, a follow-up appointment with a specialist is recommended for further evaluation and to determine the best course of treatment.
