**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Infant: Male
- Gestational Age at Birth: 38 weeks
- Mother's Age: 32 years old
- Parity: Primiparous

**Birth and Initial Presentation:**
- The infant developed respiratory distress within an hour of birth and was transferred to the neonatal intensive care nursery for treatment with supplemental oxygen. Respiratory symptoms resolved on day two.

**Feeding History:**
- Initially fed colostrum until resolution of respiratory symptoms.
- Breastfeeding was initiated with the use of a nipple shield to aid attachment.
- Three hourly breastfeeds were supplemented with infant formula or expressed breast milk (EBM).
- Exclusively fed breast milk from day four.

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical features of Down syndrome were identified on the night of birth, and diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing on day six.
- No associated health complications such as congenital cardiac anomalies, thyroid disease, or gastrointestinal malformations like Hirschsprungâ€™s disease were identified.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- The family was discharged home with instructions to breastfeed and supplement with EBM every 3 hours.

**Follow-Up and Lactation Consultation:**
- At 3 weeks, the mother expressed concerns about milk transfer and the continued use of a nipple shield. She felt her milk supply was reducing and sought help from an international board certified lactation consultant.
- After measurement of 24-hour milk production, informed written consent was provided to participate in a longitudinal study of infant sucking dynamics, milk production, and transfer.

**Feeding at 4 Weeks:**
- The infant was breastfeeding with a nipple shield and supplemented with EBM after most feeds. The infant was noted to be sleepy during both breast and bottle feeding.
- Chin support and dancer hand techniques were trialed to aid feeding but were not found to be helpful.
- Simultaneous breast expression was performed twice daily using a hospital-grade electric breast pump.

**Milk Supply:**
- The 24-hour milk profile confirmed low supply, leading to an increase in expression frequency.

**Nipple Shield Use:**
- Nipple shield use was discontinued at 8 weeks due to a maternal sensation of nipple tightness.
