**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:08:21 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Past Medical History:** Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of omphalocele repair (20 years ago).

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe upper abdominal pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with severe upper abdominal pain. The patient has a known history of pancreatic serous cystadenoma diagnosed 10 years ago via CT scan, with follow-up MRI, endoscopic ultrasound, fine needle aspiration, serology, and blood test screening. The patient attended follow-up scans regularly for six years but has not attended for the last four years.

**Emergency Department Admission:**  
- **Imaging:** Chest and abdominal x-rays were performed but results were inconclusive.
- **Laboratory Studies:** Marked leukocytosis, severe anemia, and blood glucose levels over 500 mg/dl.
- **Intravenous Contrast CT Scan:** Revealed a large amount of free peritoneal air and free fluid, a left upper quadrant 17 cm large mass originating from the stomach, and secondary liver lesions.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
An urgent laparotomy was performed, revealing a prepyloric ulcer perforation and a large inoperable mass arising from the pancreatic body, largely invading the posterior wall of the stomach and occupying the upper abdomen with multiple hepatic secondary lesions. The stomach perforation was sutured closed, and a washout was performed. A liver biopsy was taken.

**Pathology Findings:**  
Biopsy material showed small and medium-sized cystic lesions surrounded and divided by a hyalloid collagenous matrix. The cysts were lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and round nuclei without atypical or mitotic activity, as demonstrated by pathology. The glycogen content was documented by PAS positive reaction.

**Diagnosis:**  
Serous microcystic adenoma of the pancreas with confirmed malignant nature due to the presence of an extensive invasive large inoperable pancreatic mass with hepatic involvement.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to schedule a follow-up appointment with a specialist for close monitoring of the situation.
