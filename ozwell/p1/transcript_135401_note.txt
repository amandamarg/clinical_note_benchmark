**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pulsatile mass on the right side of the neck, below the angle of the mandible.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient first noticed the mass 13 years ago. Initially treated conservatively, the patient underwent endovascular treatment with parent vessel occlusion 4 years ago due to symptoms of enlargement of the mass and dyspnea on exertion. The treatment resulted in a reduction in the size of the mass and improvement of symptoms. However, over the past 6 months, the mass has started to enlarge again, with symptoms and its pulsatile nature becoming more evident. The patient denies any neurologic symptoms.

**Past Medical History:**  
- No history of infective lesion, trauma, or aneurysm disease in the family.
- No palpable lymphadenopathy noted.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Pulsatile mass observed on the right side of the neck.
- No anomalies found in the examination of cranial nerves.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Computed tomography angiography and 3D reconstruction revealed a fusiform giant aneurysm of the right ICA, measuring 5 cm in diameter.
- 3D reconstruction confirmed a fusiform aneurysm arising from the proximal right EICA with minimal flow in the EICA, possibly due to recanalization.
- No intracranial aneurysmal disease identified.
- Aneurysm measurements: 25 mm Ã— 30 mm, cranial-caudal length of 50 mm, with a wide neck extending from 2 cm after the carotid bifurcation nearly to the base of the skull.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has a fusiform giant aneurysm of the right ICA. Despite previous endovascular management, the aneurysm has recanalized and enlarged, causing troublesome symptoms. The patient has elected for surgical correction as a definitive solution. Surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible, followed by regular follow-up appointments to monitor progress.

**Patient's Decision:**  
The patient is keen for a definitive solution and agrees to proceed with surgical correction.

**Follow-Up:**  
Post-surgery follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress.
