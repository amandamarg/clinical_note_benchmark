**Surgeon:** Dr. Y  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  

**Medical History:**  
- History of subarachnoid hemorrhage  
- Lumbar peritoneal shunt tube implanted for hydrocephalus  

**Reason for Visit:**  
- Breast reconstruction following nipple areola sparing mastectomy of the left breast  

**Preoperative Findings:**  
- Preoperative CT scan showed shunt tube piercing intervertebral lumbar, traveling through the subcutaneous layer of the left trunk, and entering the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle  

**Surgical Plan:**  
- Implant reconstruction deemed unsuitable for achieving morphologically favorable results  
- Latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap insufficient in volume  
- Decision to use an abdominal flap (DIEP flap reconstruction)  
- Consultation with brain surgeons to withdraw and reinsert shunt tube during flap elevation and donor site closure  

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Skin incision made around the whole circumference of the flap  
- Dissection carried out down to the muscle fascia  
- Shunt tube confirmed above the fascia on the left side of the abdomen  
- Perforator vessel secured passing through the right rectus sheath, confirmed by color Doppler ultrasound preoperatively  
- Pedicle of the DIEP flap prepared on the right side due to shunt tube placement on the left  

**Outcome:**  
- Surgery proceeded as planned without complications  

**Postoperative Status:**  
- Patient reports feeling good  
- Plan to monitor healing and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week  

**Follow-up:**  
- Follow-up appointment scheduled in one week to monitor healing progress
