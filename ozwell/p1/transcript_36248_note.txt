**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Department:** Thoracic Surgery  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Follow-up for mediastinal mass and coronary artery disease.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred by their family physician for further evaluation of a mediastinal mass that has been followed for nearly two years. Initially observed near the left cardiac margin via echocardiography, the patient previously refused further evaluation or surgical intervention. Recently, the patient was readmitted to the thoracic surgery department for further evaluation.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Chest roentgenogram revealed a well-circumscribed mass in the middle zone of the left lung field.
- Chest tomography showed a well-circumscribed huge cystic mass near the aortic arch and left pulmonary artery, and a small cystic mass on the sixth costosternal junction.
- During preparation for surgery, the patient developed angina pectoris.
- Coronary angiography revealed an atherosclerotic lesion causing significant stenosis in the proximal and mid portions of the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery.

**Surgical Plan and Procedure:**  
A one-stage combined operation was planned to remove the tumors and perform coronary artery bypass grafting. Preoperative evaluation suggested that the mass on the aortic arch might complicate proximal anastomoses of coronary bypass. Therefore, the decision was made to first remove the mass, followed by coronary artery bypass grafting using sternotomy.

During the procedure, the chest was opened by sternotomy. A huge encapsulated mass was removed by blunt and sharp dissection. Additionally, a smaller tumor originating from the intercostal nerve was also excised.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
The patient is instructed to return for regular check-ups and adhere to prescribed medications. The patient was advised to contact the clinic with any questions or concerns.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments.
- Monitor recovery and response to surgery.
- Ensure compliance with medication regimen.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient was informed about the importance of follow-up visits and medication adherence. They were encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
