**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  
**Clinic:** Oncology Clinic  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Large ulcerated nodule in the left cheek and neck region.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a history of a squamous cell skin cancer lesion in the left mandibular region, first documented five years ago. The lesion was initially excised with clear margins but recurred 12 months ago. Due to poor socioeconomic status, the patient was unable to admit to the hospital at the time of recurrence. The condition has since deteriorated, with the cancerous lesion becoming too painful and causing difficulty in eating. The Radiation Oncology department determined that radiotherapy would be difficult to tolerate due to the deeply ulcerated and large size of the lesion. A biopsy confirmed tumor recurrence, and a CT scan of the head and neck region demonstrated extensive soft tissue invasion of the tumor. The patient was referred to the medical oncology department for chemotherapy. A standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy was deemed inappropriate due to the patient's poor clinical status. Instead, the patient was treated with single-agent cetuximab every 15 days for 6 months.

**Treatment Course:**  
After the second cycle of cetuximab treatment, the patient's performance status improved, and the ulcerous lesion regressed. During treatment, the patient developed a grade 2 acneiform rash on the face, neck, and mediastinum, which was managed with vitamin K1 cream without requiring dose reduction. The patient also developed grade 3 anemia in the fifth month of treatment, which was managed with red blood cell transfusions as needed. The treatment was terminated at the end of 6 months as the patient denied any further therapy.

**Follow-Up:**  
At the last follow-up visit, 12 months after the end of cetuximab therapy, the patient remains in complete clinical remission.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient for any signs of recurrence.
- Address any new symptoms or concerns as they arise.
- Provide supportive care as needed to maintain remission status.
