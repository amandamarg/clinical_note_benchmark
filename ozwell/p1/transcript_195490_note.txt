**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Attending Physician:** [Redacted]  
**Reason for Admission:** Induction of labor at 37 2/7 weeks due to abnormal antenatal testing.  

**History:**  
The patient has a history of a prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm and opted for a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC).  

**Admission Findings:**  
- Initial cervical exam: 2 cm dilation, 50% effacement.  

**Labor Induction:**  
- Induced with oxytocin.  
- Amniotomy performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted.  

**Labor Progression:**  
- Progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over 10 hours.  
- Progressed from 5 cm to 6 cm over 3.5 hours.  

**Complications During Labor:**  
- Moderate vaginal bleeding.  
- Minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations, which did not improve with intrauterine resuscitation.  

**Intervention:**  
Due to concerns of uterine rupture or placental abruption, the patient was taken to the operating room for a repeat cesarean delivery.  

**Cesarean Delivery Findings:**  
- No evidence of uterine rupture or dehiscence.  
- No significant placental abruption.  
- Delivered a healthy male infant weighing 2659 g with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  
- Arterial cord pH was 7.26.  

**Post-Delivery Findings:**  
- Bladder was distended and edematous despite a patent Foley catheter.  
- Vaginal exam revealed spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock.  
- Avulsed portion of cervix appeared necrotic with no bleeding at the site of detachment.  
- Attempted vaginal repair resulted in complete detachment of the cervix with no excessive bleeding.  

**Plan:**  
- Close monitoring of recovery and potential complications.  
- Discussion of future pregnancies and delivery options.  
- Immediate reporting of any abnormal symptoms.  
- Communication with the patient's family to keep them informed of progress.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be supported throughout recovery, and further evaluations will be conducted as necessary.
