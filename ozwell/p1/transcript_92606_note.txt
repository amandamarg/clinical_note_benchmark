**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:41:36 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Reason for Visit:** Referred by a friend for issues with anterior teeth appearance post-accident.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports dissatisfaction with the appearance of anterior teeth following a dentoalveolar trauma and subsequent surgical operation in 2004. The patient initially consulted a plastic surgeon, who indicated the issue was dental in nature.

**Examination:**  
- Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed.
- All maxillary incisors are vestibulary positioned.
- Right canine and maxillary incisors exhibit oblique fractures involving enamel.
- Left lateral incisor is intact.
- Maxillary segment between the right premolar and left canine is approximately 3 mm lower than its ideal position, with a possible deviation off the vertical axis.

**Assessment:**  
- Misplacement of the maxillary segment.
- Oblique fractures of the right canine and maxillary incisors.
- Non-vital maxillary right central incisor and first premolar.

**Plan:**  
- Discussed the option of segmental osteotomy to correct misplacement, but the patient prefers to avoid further surgical operations due to previous negative experiences.
- Proposed conservative treatment:
  - Porcelain laminate veneers for maxillary incisors and right canine.
  - All ceramic crown for maxillary right first premolar due to excessive hard tissue loss.
  - Metal-ceramic fixed partial denture for anterior mandible for economic reasons.
- Endodontic treatment required for maxillary right central incisor and first premolar.
- Preparation for ceramic veneers will involve reducing facial surfaces by 1.5-2 mm and incisal edges by 3 mm.

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule endodontic and prosthetic treatments.
- Patient has no further questions or concerns at this time.
