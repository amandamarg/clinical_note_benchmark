**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:26:20 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain in right leg and difficulty walking.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a gradual onset of pain in the right leg, which has worsened over time. Initially able to walk independently, the patient now requires a cane and eventually a walker. An MRI of the lumbar spine conducted a month prior revealed a mild disk bulge at L3-4 and L4-5. The patient was prescribed a Medrol Dosepak for a herniated disk and right lower extremity radiculopathy, but continued to experience pain and difficulty ambulating.

The patient presented to the obstetric service at 38 weeks with elevated blood pressure and headaches, leading to admission for induction of labor. After 16 hours of labor, a cesarean section was performed due to concerns of worsening right lower extremity radiculopathy and suspected fetal macrosomia, complicated by intrapartum hemorrhage. Post-cesarean, the patient experienced increased severe pain in the right hip and was unable to ambulate.

**Consultations and Imaging:**  
The obstetrics and gynecology team consulted the neurology service, which recommended an MRI of the pelvis to evaluate for possible compressive femoral nerve neuropathy. The neurology team initiated a low dose of prednisone. The pelvic MRI revealed a displaced right femoral neck fracture with signs of femoral head bone marrow edema and a focal area of bone edema in the left femoral head with mild flattening. The radiologist described the areas of edema in both hips as possible osteonecrosis (ON). The orthopaedic service was consulted, and a pelvic radiograph was obtained.

**Past Medical History:**  
- No known history of trauma or falls during pregnancy.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient presents with a displaced right femoral neck fracture and signs of femoral head bone marrow edema. Referral to an orthopaedic specialist is recommended for further evaluation and treatment.
