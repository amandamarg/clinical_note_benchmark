**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Redacted]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient was referred from an outside clinic and has a history of breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy of the right breast with axillary lymph node dissection 34 months ago. The pathology report from the surgery documented infiltrating ductal carcinoma with clear resection margins. Three out of 16 regional lymph nodes were positive for adenocarcinoma cells, but lymphovascular invasion was negative. The cancer was staged as T2N1M0 according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Post-surgery, a catheter was placed for drainage from the lumpectomy site, which was later removed. The patient completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil regimen, and received radiotherapy of the whole breast. Regular checkups at the outside clinic showed no evidence of recurrence through imaging studies.

The patient presented today with a palpable lump on the right chest wall. She described it as an approximately 2 cm sized moveable subcutaneous nodule with a rubbery consistency located on the middle axillary line at the level of the nipple. There is a scar on the skin directly superficial to the nodule, which the patient claims is the wound site of the drain catheter insertion during the lumpectomy.

**Objective:**  
Recent ultrasonography of the breast and chest wall showed a well-demarcated subcutaneous mass measuring 1.8 cm in length, with no other abnormalities in the remaining breast. A sonographically guided 14-gauge core needle biopsy of the nodule showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma. A whole body bone scan and whole body positron emission tomography scan did not demonstrate any suspected metastatic lesions other than the nodule at the right chest wall. A chest CT was obtained in addition to ultrasonography to evaluate the extent and depth of the nodule.

**Assessment:**  
The findings suggest a recurrence of breast cancer at the right chest wall.

**Plan:**  
Further tests and consultations with specialists will be scheduled to develop a comprehensive treatment plan. The patient is advised to stay positive and take care of herself in the meantime.
