**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** [Date of Visit]  
**Physician:** [Physician's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Swelling and pain in the right groin.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with swelling and pain in the right groin, which has been present for a few days. The swelling measured approximately 10 Ã— 10 cm. No additional symptoms were reported.

**Examination and Tests:**  
Vital signs and blood tests were performed and returned normal results. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a prolapse of the small intestine into the right groin, indicating an indirect hernia. No apparent intestinal ischemia was observed.

**Treatment and Hospitalization:**  
A manual return of the intestine was performed, and the patient was hospitalized for observation. The patient was discharged 3 days later after confirming no complications such as intestinal ischemia.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
Surgery was agreed upon on a watch-and-wait basis, and a Transabdominal Preperitoneal Repair (TAPP) was used to repair the hernia. The operation was performed in a supine position under general anesthesia. Examination of the abdominal cavity revealed a coexistence of a femoral hernia and an indirect inguinal hernia on the right side, as well as an indirect inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia on the left side. Although asymptomatic, surgery was indicated for the left side, and a simultaneous repair was performed.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
Two 5-mm ports were placed in the left and right abdomen, respectively, with a total of three ports used for the operation. The first repair was performed on the right hernia. The peritoneum was incised, and the space between the peritoneum and the preperitoneal fat was separated to form a space for placing the mesh. Exfoliation was performed to include the thigh ring.

**Follow-Up:**  
A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks to assess the patient's recovery and progress.

**Plan:**  
Monitor the patient's recovery and ensure no complications arise post-surgery. Follow-up in a few weeks to evaluate the surgical outcomes and overall health status.
