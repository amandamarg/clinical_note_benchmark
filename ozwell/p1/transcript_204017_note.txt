**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:17:31 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [Patient's MRN]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports not feeling well and presents with complaints of a persistent orocutaneous fistula. The patient has a history of a plasmacytoma removal from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago. The patient was referred to our clinic for this issue.

**Objective:**  
CT images demonstrate a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous operations have been unsuccessful in closing the fistula.

**Assessment:**  
The persistent orocutaneous fistula is believed to be due to ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula.

**Plan:**  
We have decided to use the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. The fistula will be excised, and healthy soft tissues will be prepared. The incision will be extended at the extraoral site, following previous incision lines. Dissection will occur in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible, exposing the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible. The gland will be mobilized while protecting the arteriovenous supply and the duct. At the oral site, the wound margins will be released and closed with mattress sutures via 5/0 polypropylene. A soft tissue tunnel will be prepared between the submandibular space and the defect area, and the submandibular gland will be rotated through the tunnel, preserving the pedicle. The rotated gland will be sutured to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization. The cutaneous site will be closed. Post-procedure follow-up care instructions will be provided to the patient.

**Discussion:**  
The patient understands the complexity of the procedure and has been informed about the steps involved. We aim for a successful outcome in closing the fistula.

**Follow-up:**  
Post-operative care instructions will be given, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's recovery and the success of the procedure.
