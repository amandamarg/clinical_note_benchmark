**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with complaints of worsening pain in the left arm following a fall approximately three months ago. The patient reports a sharp pain in the left proximal forearm and decreased range of motion, with the inability to move the arm as well as before. The patient has a history of surgery on the left elbow for posttraumatic arthritis at age 18.

**Objective:**  
- Physical examination revealed the elbow is fused at 90 degrees with limited pronation (40 degrees) and supination (60 degrees).  
- Motor and sensory examination of the hand is normal.  
- Radiographs showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.  
- The patient developed a hypertrophic nonunion of the ulnar shaft fracture post-fall, treated with a cast for three months. Motion through the nonunion site worsened, and the patient expressed dissatisfaction with the functional limitations of the elbow arthrodesis.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
- Discussed surgical options for the ulna nonunion with the patient at the clinic visit three months post-fall. Decided on conservative treatment for an additional three months.  
- Due to prior surgery, trauma history, and infection risk, opted to combine the repair of the nonunion and conversion of the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty into one procedure. The stem of the ulnar component will serve as an intramedullary device.  
- During the procedure, the patient was placed in a supine position, and a posterior incision was made over the elbow. A prior muscle flap used for soft tissue coverage was elevated. The ulnar nerve, encased in scar tissue, required meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach to the elbow joint was performed, and multiple buried pins were inserted.  
- The patient was informed about the procedure and follow-up appointments to monitor progress. The patient was advised to reach out with any concerns or questions.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will need to return for follow-up appointments to monitor healing and progress. Further instructions and care will be provided as needed.
