**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** The patient has a history of bilateral resection of adrenal gland tumors, with the left side resected at age 46 and the right side at age 50. Both tumors were diagnosed as pheochromocytoma, and no adjuvant therapy was administered. There is no history of trauma or radiation therapy at the tumor site. No family history of carcinomas or sarcomas.

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Severe pain on the right side of the abdomen for 4 months.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Palpation revealed a fixed stony-hard tumor approximately 100 mm in diameter on the right side of the abdomen, slightly tender upon pressure.

**Investigations:**  
- **Blood Examination:** All values within normal limits.
- **Abdominal CT Scan:** Large mass with diffuse calcification, approximately 130 × 110 mm, located in the right retroperitoneal space between the right kidney and the inferior vena cava, with slight hydronephrosis. No lymph node swelling, ascites, liver tumor, or lung tumor detected.
- **Chest CT Scan:** No abnormalities detected.

**Preoperative Diagnosis:**  
- Recurrent pheochromocytoma, retroperitoneal osteosarcoma, or leiomyosarcoma.

**Surgical Findings:**  
- Complete surgical resection of the primary tumor was performed. The tumor was located behind the mesenterium of the ascending colon, compressing the right kidney, with no direct invasion of surrounding organs. No lymph node swelling, ascites, or peritoneal dissemination. The tumor was not present in the parenchyma of the liver and kidney. The surgical margin was determined based on the rough connective tissue surrounding the tumor. Lymph node dissection was not performed.

**Gross Examination:**  
- The tumor was rounded, bony, and hard, measuring approximately 140 × 110 × 80 mm and weighing 1100 g. It was yellowish-white in color.

**Histological Findings:**  
- The tumor consisted of a mixture of dense fibrous tissue, woven bone, and atypical cartilage. Some osteoclastic giant cells were observed. Woven bone trabeculae were arranged irregularly and were anastomosed.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for further tests and evaluation.
