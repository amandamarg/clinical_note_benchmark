**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented today with concerns regarding a previous surgery performed 2 years ago for a transverse patellar fracture of the right knee. The patient reports that the wire used in the surgery has perforated the skin. The patient underwent tension band wiring and cerclage wiring for the treatment. Initially, the patient had no symptoms such as irritation due to the wire or limitation of range of motion. The patient had a clinical examination and plain radiography at 16 weeks postoperatively but was lost to follow-up until now.

**Objective:**  
Upon examination of the radiographs, it was observed that the cerclage wire was broken into pieces, and a fragment had migrated into the posterior compartment. It was unclear from plain radiographs or three-dimensional computed tomography whether the wire fragment was in the posterior compartment of the knee joint or the popliteal fossa, posing a risk of chondral damage if inside the joint or neurovascular damage if in the popliteal fossa.

**Assessment:**  
The patient underwent a procedure where a skin incision was made over the previous incision, and all wires were removed. An arthroscopic examination was performed. During the routine arthroscopic assessment through the standard anteromedial portal, no structural damage, including chondral lesions due to wire migration, was found. The posterior compartment was examined through the posteromedial or posterolateral portal, but the wire fragment could not be located by palpating with a probe introduced through these portals.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to have continuous follow-up and return for a check-up in a week. The patient is instructed to return immediately if any symptoms such as pain or swelling occur. Further postoperative examination is necessary to determine if there is any damage before approaching the popliteal fossa.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
- Return for a follow-up appointment in one week.
- Monitor for any symptoms such as pain or swelling and return immediately if they occur.
