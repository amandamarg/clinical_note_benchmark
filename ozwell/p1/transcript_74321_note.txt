**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:15:46 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient was referred for re-implantation of the right breast following a rupture and explantation during thoracic surgery. The patient has a history of breast cancer diagnosed in 1984, for which a mastectomy and radiochemotherapy were performed, followed by secondary reconstruction with a silicone implant. In 2015, the patient was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma and bilateral pulmonary metastases and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with a wedge resection of the right lung. During this procedure, there was a perforation of the silicone implant and injury to the thoracic wall. The perforated breast implant was removed without a diagnosis of the defect.

**Current Condition:**  
The patient is in stable condition and has expressed a strong desire for breast re-implantation.

**Procedure Details:**  
During the re-implantation procedure, a minor defect was observed in the thoracic wall and parietal pleura. A thin layer of material was used to securely close the defect, allowing for re-implantation. The highly vascularized capsule tissue was utilized to create a pedicled flap, which was a minimally invasive treatment option compared to closure with a muscle flap or addition of non-autologous tissue, reducing the risk of infection. The anterior part of the capsule in relation to the pectoral muscle was dissected free, rotated, and sutured shut.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. The patient was advised to contact the office with any questions or concerns in the meantime.
