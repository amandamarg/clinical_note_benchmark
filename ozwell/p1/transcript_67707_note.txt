**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:59 PM  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents with increasing right knee pain and debility. The patient has a history of osteochondritis dissecans diagnosed at age 13, initially treated conservatively. Pain recurred, leading to an arthroscopic examination at age 14, which showed a stable lesion. Despite conservative management, the patient underwent a repeat arthroscopy a year later, where an unstable lesion was removed, and a chondral biopsy was taken for autologous chondrocyte transplantation. No healing occurred at the defect site. Two months later, a matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant (MACI) was used to patch the defect, fixed with fibrin glue. One year post-procedure, the patient experienced discomfort and swelling, with arthroscopy revealing partial incorporation of the MACI patch. At age 23, due to discomfort and mechanical instability, another arthroscopy was performed, revealing numerous loose bodies and failure of the past OCD and MACI graft, with exposure of subchondral bone and a large subchondral cyst. Currently, the patient is unable to perform activities involving prolonged weight-bearing and is finding it increasingly difficult to continue their occupation in allied health care.

**Objective:**  
Tests were performed to assess the current condition of the knee.

**Assessment:**  
The patient's knee pain and debility are related to the history of osteochondritis dissecans and previous surgical interventions.

**Plan:**  
1. Recommend physical therapy to reduce pain and improve mobility.
2. Prescribe pain medication as needed.
3. Advise the use of a knee brace for support.
4. Instruct the patient to avoid activities that stress the knee, such as running or jumping.
5. Encourage maintaining a healthy weight to reduce knee pressure.
6. Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be contacted to schedule a follow-up appointment. They are advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
