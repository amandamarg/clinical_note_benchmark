**Time:** 6:57:05 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Medical Record Number:** [Patient's MRN]  
**Attending Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with complaints of pain in the thigh for the past few days. The patient has a history of a femur fracture in the supracondylar region sustained 3 months ago, which was initially managed with a dynamic condylar screw assembly. Postoperatively, the patient was discharged with advice to undergo supervised physiotherapy. The patient later reported to the emergency department with thigh pain, and X-rays revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate-bone interface. Revision surgery with a longer barrel plate was performed. After 4 months, the patient experienced pain in the peri-implant area while bearing weight, and radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri-implant region. The femoral neck radiograph showed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh's classification.

**Objective:**  
- Radiographs: Fracture of the femur at the new peri-implant region.
- Osteoporosis grading: 3 according to Singh's classification.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a history of femur fracture with complications leading to multiple surgeries. The current issue involves a fracture at the peri-implant region with associated osteoporosis.

**Plan:**  
A less invasive and less destructive method was planned to address the fracture. The proposed surgery was explained to the patient and attendants, and ethical board permission was obtained. During surgery, screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure the patency of the intramedullary canal, leaving the plate in situ to avoid re-exposure of the bone surface. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. An external locking device comprising a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods was used to address anticipated difficulties in distal locking with an in situ plate. No blood transfusion or bone grafting was used, and the mean operating time was 40 minutes. The patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day and discharged from the hospital on the same day with advice on range of motion exercises of the knee. The patient was advised to compress the fracture at a rate of 1 mm per day in divided increments.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be seen for follow-up to monitor progress and healing.
