**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Mrs. Susan  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Mrs. Susan reports persistent pain throughout her body, with severe pain localized in her hands and legs. She has a history of carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand, which provided only temporary relief. She has tried various treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, but these have not been effective and, in some cases, exacerbated her pain. She experiences weakness in her legs and has difficulty with bladder and bowel control, leading to frequent falls.

**Objective:**
Mrs. Susan underwent an MRI and emergency surgery in May 2011 to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. Post-surgery, she experienced paralysis on the right side of her body. A subsequent surgery in August 2012 intended for pain relief resulted in increased pain. She currently receives weekly injections for pain relief, which provide marginal benefit for about a week. She is on high doses of medication for nerve pain, which also offer limited relief. She reports areas of heightened sensitivity on her legs, where even light contact, such as a bed sheet, causes pain.

**Assessment:**
Mrs. Susan's symptoms suggest ongoing issues potentially related to spinal cord compression or nerve damage. Her history of surgeries and current pain management strategies indicate a complex pain syndrome that requires further investigation.

**Plan:**
1. Schedule imaging tests, including an MRI, to assess for spinal cord compression or other structural issues.
2. Conduct nerve tests to evaluate for potential nerve damage.
3. Follow up with Mrs. Susan to discuss test results and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.

**Follow-up:**
Mrs. Susan will be contacted to schedule the necessary tests and will return for a follow-up appointment to review the results and discuss further management options.
