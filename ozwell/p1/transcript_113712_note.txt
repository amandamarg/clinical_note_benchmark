The patient also reports paresthesia in the right hand, particularly in the median nerve distribution.

Median nerve tumor.

**Treatment Plan:**
- Surgical excision of the tumor under supraclavicular block with bupivacaine and Xylocaine, under tourniquet control.
- Intraoperative exploration of the nerve and resection of the well-encapsulated tumor using microsurgical techniques.
- Potential for neurological deficit post-surgery, with the possibility of requiring a sural nerve graft.

**Histopathological Examination:**
The specimen showed typical features of schwannoma, with spindle cells forming Verocay bodies and clearly identified Antony A and B areas.

**Follow-Up:**
At the two-month follow-up, the patient was symptom-free with mild paresthesia in the index and middle fingers. There was no motor deficit or pain, and no recurrence of the tumor. The patient is scheduled for another follow-up in two months.
