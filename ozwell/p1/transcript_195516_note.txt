**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 49 years
- Gender: Male
- Medical History: No previous medical history

**Chief Complaint:**
- Pain along the left side of the neck and difficulty swallowing following trauma from a foreign object at a construction site.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient was struck by a foreign object on a construction site, resulting in pain along the left side of the neck and difficulty swallowing. There were no signs of active bleeding or hemodynamic instability upon initial evaluation. The patient did not exhibit Horner's syndrome. The point of the nail was not visible in the oral cavity but was palpable along the left side of the oropharynx. The patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection without complications.

**Imaging and Findings:**
A CT angiography of the neck was performed, revealing the nail's proximity to the left internal carotid artery with preserved flow proximal and distal to the nail. There was no active contrast extravasation or definitive presence of a pseudoaneurysm, although the evaluation was limited by beam-hardening artifact from the nail. 

The patient was transported to the interventional radiology suite for further evaluation. Left common carotid angiography demonstrated preserved flow through the left internal carotid artery but significant vessel narrowing at the level of the nail. 3D rotational angiography showed small areas of contrast stagnation proximal and distal to the nail with a small dissection flap proximal to the nail, indicating at least a partial vessel injury. The intracranial left anterior circulation imaged normally without abnormal vessel dropout.

**Plan:**
After discussion among trauma surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and neurointerventional teams, it was determined that the best course of action would be to monitor the injury closely.

**Outcome:**
Despite close monitoring, the patient eventually passed away due to complications from the partial vessel injury. All possible efforts were made to manage the injury, but it was too severe.
