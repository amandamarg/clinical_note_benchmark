**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Admitted to the gastroenterology unit with portal vein obstruction and massive malena.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient was referred for an antenatal check-up to the obstetric unit after a clinical examination revealed gross fetal hydrops. She was transferred to the obstetric unit for further evaluation and management. Her prenatal course was complicated by recurrent episodes of hematemesis and malena for 10 years prior to admission, with a previous diagnosis of esophageal varices. She has had multiple blood transfusions and sclerotherapy sessions.

**Obstetric History:**
- **Previous Pregnancy:** Resulted in a single offspring. The first pregnancy was 2 years prior to admission, with regular supervised antenatal check-ups during the first and second trimesters and a normal anomaly scan. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus controlled through diet and episodes of recurrent malena. The third trimester was unsupervised at home. The patient was admitted to a local private practitioner at the onset of labor and underwent a caesarean section for meconium-stained liquor, delivering a grossly normal male baby with jaundice at birth. The baby received a blood transfusion on the third day of life and died on the seventh day.

- **Present Pregnancy:** A spontaneous conception with first and second trimester antenatal check-ups with a private practitioner in the patient's hometown. At 29 weeks of gestation, the patient presented in the gastroenterology department with massive malena and anemia. Upper GI endoscopy revealed grade II esophageal varices, for which sclerotherapy was performed. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells to raise hemoglobin from 6 gm% to 10 gm%. Upon obstetric referral, ultrasonography at 30 weeks and 5 days revealed severe fetal hydrops, and Doppler studies suggested fetal anemia. The patient was given corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity. At 31 weeks, cordocentesis was performed.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and provide necessary care.
