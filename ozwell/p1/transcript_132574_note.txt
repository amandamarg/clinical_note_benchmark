**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]  
- **Age:** [Patient's Age]  
- **Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  
- **Background:** The patient comes from a very poor background and depends entirely on daily wages and manual labor to support themselves and their family.

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Traumatic amputation of the left hand following a fall from a height in the jungle.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient experienced a traumatic amputation of the left hand after falling from a height in the jungle. Following the incident, the patient received an anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin according to WHO protocol due to suspected involvement of wild animals. Additionally, the patient suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was managed conservatively by the neurosurgery department.

**Past Medical and Surgical History:**  
- No past medical or surgical history reported.

**Social History:**  
- The patient relies on daily wages and manual labor for livelihood. The loss of hand functionality has been devastating and depressing, impacting their ability to perform daily chores and meet financial needs.

**Treatment History:**  
- The patient was advised to get a high-end prosthesis, but it was beyond their budget.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The main problem is to stabilize the patient and enable them to reintegrate into society without dependency. A Krukenberg operation has been planned as the best available option, despite it being seldom performed and not recommended by many surgeons. The procedure will follow the classical method described by Swanson and Swanson with a few modifications. A longitudinal incision will be made on the flexor surface of the forearm, and a similar incision on the dorsal surface slightly toward the ulnar side. The forearm muscles will be separated into two groups and resected to reduce the stump size. The pronator teres will be conserved as it is the main operating muscle, with all precautions taken to maintain its integrity.

**Patient Education:**  
The procedure was explained in detail to the patient, including videos and photographs to elaborate on the process. The patient expressed understanding and trust in the medical team.

**Follow-Up:**  
The surgery will be scheduled as soon as possible. Post-operative follow-up will be necessary to monitor the patient's progress.
