**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Department:** Orthopedics  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Wound dehiscence on the left knee with hardware exposure.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a painful wound on the left knee with hardware exposure. The patient reports that the wound has been bothering her for a while. She denies any other medical issues or comorbidities.

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient underwent a total left hip arthroplasty eight years ago due to severe osteoarthritis pain that hindered baseline activities. Recently, she presented with progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, causing difficulties in deambulation. An X-ray examination revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. An MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation), leading to a revision total hip arthroplasty with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. 

Three weeks post-surgery, the patient experienced early symptoms of infection, including high fever, suppuration, no wound healing, and laboratory abnormalities. Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful. A two-stage replacement of the endoprosthesis femur was planned. In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Initially, a lateral gastrocnemius flap was considered, but the surrounding area was highly scarred, and the gastrocnemius muscle was very atrophic and not suitable to fit the large defect. No other local flaps were large enough to cover the whole defect, so a free flap was opted for. However, there was a lack of receptor vessels, and the descending genicular artery was dissected but found to have a small caliber and calcified plaques in the lumen, which discarded its use.

**Family Concerns:**  
The patient's family expressed concern about her condition and were informed about the current situation and the steps being taken to address the wound dehiscence and hardware exposure.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the wound and explore alternative options for wound coverage. Further discussions with the surgical team to determine the best course of action for wound management and potential additional interventions. Keep the family informed of any developments and involve them in the decision-making process.
