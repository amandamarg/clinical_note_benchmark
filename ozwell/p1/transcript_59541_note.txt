**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:21:24 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Department:** Neurology  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing two transitory episodes lasting several hours, characterized by language impairment and mild confusion.  

**Objective:**  
- Neurologic examination: Unremarkable  
- Brain computed tomography scan: Unremarkable  
- Electroencephalographic test: Unremarkable  

**Assessment:**  
A transient ischemic attack was suspected based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.  

**Plan:**  
- Carotid duplex ultrasound examination was performed, revealing a parallel arterial flow at the origin of the internal carotid artery, resembling a double lumen.  
- Magnetic resonance angiography of the neck vessels was conducted to exclude dissection of the internal carotid artery. The imaging excluded carotid artery dissection but identified an arterial branch arising from the post-bulbar internal carotid artery and flowing in close proximity to it.  
- The patient provided written informed consent for the report of case details and imaging studies.  

**Discussion:**  
Carotid duplex ultrasound is a valuable tool in everyday practice, especially when a cerebrovascular etiology is suspected. However, normal ultrasound findings do not rule out the possibility of carotid dissection. Supportive ultrasound findings, such as a potential double lumen, warrant further diagnostic examinations, including angiography with magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography.  

In contrast, evaluating potential anatomic variants of the external carotid artery is rare in neurologic ultrasound examination of supra-aortic trunks. Two anatomic variants with an aberrant origin should be considered: an ascending pharyngeal artery or an occipital artery. These arteries typically arise from the external carotid artery but can rarely present as anatomic variants with an aberrant origin from the internal carotid artery. The temporal tap maneuver is routinely applied to differentiate the external and internal carotid arteries.  

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to make an appointment for a follow-up examination in two weeks.
