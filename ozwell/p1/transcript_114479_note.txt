**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:34:16 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient presented with a seizure attack during a brain MRI scan at a local hospital. The patient reported experiencing severe headaches for approximately three weeks. There is no history of epilepsy or other medical diseases, except for a surgical history of cholecystectomy in 2014. Upon admission to the emergency department, the patient was alert and without any neurologic deficit.

**Imaging and Findings:**  
- Initial brain CT scan revealed a 3.5 Ã— 3.2 cm oval-shaped mass filled with a thrombus, a midline shift to the left of 3 mm, and a slightly decreased size of the right lateral ventricle.
- Brain CT scan with contrast showed a mass-like lesion with heterogeneous enhancement, identified as a large tortuous vessel connected to an aneurysmal sac arising from the inferior trunk of the right middle cerebral artery.
- Brain MRI indicated a mass of heterogenic signal intensity, suggesting different stages of thrombus formation within the aneurysmal sac.
- Digital subtraction angiography showed contrast pooling in the inferior trunk of the right MCA and a dilated outflow.

**Symptoms:**  
Post-admission, the patient experienced no further seizure events, but symptoms of headache and dizziness persisted.

**Procedures and Tests:**  
A Balloon Occlusion Test (BOT) was conducted to assess the patency of collateral cerebral circulation. During the proximal occlusion of the aneurysm by Sceptor C balloon, the patient's somatosensory evoked potential, cognitive and language function, and motor and sensory changes were monitored for half an hour. The patient did not present any neurologic symptoms during the test.

**Plan:**  
Based on the BOT results, an endovascular embolization is planned. To prevent blood clots, the patient will be administered 100 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel for seven days.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
