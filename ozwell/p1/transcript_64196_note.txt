**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Information:**
- Patient presented with a dislocated shoulder following a ski fall.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient experienced a fall while skiing, resulting in an anterior shoulder dislocation. There was no loss of consciousness reported. Initial reduction attempts were unsuccessful, necessitating general anesthesia for further attempts.

**Emergency Department Findings:**
- No neurological dysfunction or pulse deficit was noted upon arrival.
- During the reduction attempt, a hematoma was observed in the deltopectoral region, accompanied by a loss of palpable peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia.

**Imaging and Diagnosis:**
- A CT scan revealed a compressive hematoma in the axillary region, disruption of axillary artery flow, and an incidental finding of bilateral pulmonary embolism.

**Treatment and Surgical Intervention:**
- The patient was transferred to a university hospital for specialized care by vascular and trauma surgeons.
- Successful reduction of the shoulder dislocation was achieved in the operating room.
- Due to a persistent pulsatile hematoma, arteriography was performed, revealing axillary artery disruption with contrast extravasation near the humeral head.
- An angioplasty balloon was introduced to control proximal bleeding, followed by an incision at the pectoralis major muscle to decompress the hematoma.

**Postoperative Course:**
- The bilateral pulmonary embolism was hypothesized to be due to axillary vein compression during dislocation, though unconfirmed by examination.
- The patient received intravenous anticoagulant therapy with heparin, transitioning to oral anticoagulants.
- Doppler ultrasound indicated good morphologic and hemodynamic results.
- No neurological or vascular complications were observed postoperatively.

**Functional Outcome:**
- The patient presented with partial functional disability, likely due to distal brachial plexus stunning, as indicated by electromyogram results.
- A CT scan showed the absence of significant findings.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring the patient's progress and ensure a successful recovery.
