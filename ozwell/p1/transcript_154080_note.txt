**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Progressive complaints of angina.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension diagnosed at age 18.
- Cardiac murmur diagnosed at age 18.
- History of dizziness and near collapse during exertion evaluated in 1991; no structural heart disease found besides systolic hypertension.
- Therapy refractory hypertension with no underlying cause diagnosed after referral to an internist.
- Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed at age 50, leading to cessation of smoking.
- Echocardiography at age 50 showed left ventricular hypertrophy with a septum and posterior wall diameter of 12 mm, mild aortic regurgitation, and a peak systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve of 28 mmHg (heart rate 64 beats/min).
- Treated with four different antihypertensive drugs but remained hypertensive.

**Diagnostic Tests and Procedures:**  
- 2007 nuclear exercise stress test showed signs of reversible perfusion defects in the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, suggestive of myocardial ischaemia.
- Cardiac catheterisation via the right femoral artery was unsuccessful due to discrete narrowing of the aorta.
- Catheterisation via the radial artery revealed significant stenosis in the circumflex artery, which was dilated and stented.
- Calculated peak pressure gradient across the narrowed thoracic aorta was 30 mmHg.
- CT scan of the aorta confirmed coarctation with a pinpoint stenosis just distal to the left subclavian artery.
- Extensive collateral network mainly consisting of bronchial and lumbar arteries.

**Plan:**  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor the patient's condition.

**Notes:**  
The patient has been compliant with regular cardiologist visits and antihypertensive treatment. Further monitoring and management of the coarctation and associated symptoms are necessary.
