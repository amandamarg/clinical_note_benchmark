**Chief Complaint:**  
Frequent and loud popping sound in the right hip at night after falling asleep, lasting for 9 months. The popping was painless.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred to the clinic due to a popping sound in the right hip, which has been present for 9 months. The patient's mother reported that the sound was so frequent and loud that it disturbed the family's sleep during the night for the last couple of months. The popping started after the separation of the patient's parents, and the patient has been living with the mother since then. The patient demonstrated the popping by positioning the right hip up to 90 degrees flexion and 15-20 degrees adduction, followed by a slight internal rotation, resulting in a sudden loud popping sound and posterior displacement of the hip. The hip was relocated by external rotation and abduction, which was painless.

No record of any congenital or connective tissue disease in the family.

**Laboratory and Radiographic Findings:**  
Routine lab tests were normal. Pelvic and right hip radiographs were normal. An anteroposterior radiograph after the dislocation maneuver revealed hip dislocation with a wide space between the femoral head and the acetabulum.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The nature of the problem was discussed with the patient's parents, and the family was referred to psychological consultation. The family participated in sessions of family therapy. After 3 months, the popping disappeared and did not recur during the 15 months of follow-up period.
