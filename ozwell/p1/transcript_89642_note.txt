**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:57:38 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling on the right leg and history of pulmonary embolus.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted 6 weeks ago with a history of swelling on the right leg and a pulmonary embolus. The patient reports a loss of sensation on the dorsolateral aspect of the right foot and persistent swelling. A VQ scan confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus, and the patient was anticoagulated with heparin and warfarin. The patient now presents with a large mass in the right popliteal fossa.

**Imaging and Diagnostic Tests:**  
- **VQ Scan:** Confirmed pulmonary embolus.  
- **Vascular Review:** Revealed a pulsatile mass consistent with a popliteal artery aneurysm, measuring 12 cm in diameter on the right and 6 cm on the left.  
- **Duplex Scan of Lower Limb Arteries:** Showed ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta measuring 3.4 cm in diameter.  
- **CT Arteriogram:** Confirmed a pseudo aneurysm on the right side following a rupture with peripheral calcification.  
- **Duplex Examination of Upper and Lower Limb Veins:** Veins were of small diameter.

**Physical Examination:**  
- **Circulation in Right Foot:** Warm and well perfused.  
- **INR:** 2.6.

**Treatment and Procedures:**  
- **Initial Treatment Plan:** Continued full anticoagulation rather than placing an inferior vena caval filter.  
- **Operative Exploration:** Revealed a large volume of blood pointing laterally in the popliteal artery. The popliteal aneurysm was excluded.  
- **Revascularization Procedure:** Established revascularization of the leg with an inlay 8 mm PTFE graft.  
- **Post-Operative Management:** Continuous oozing was managed by packing the aneurysm sac, with the end of the pack brought out laterally. The pack was removed at 48 hours under sedation.  
- **Recovery:** Uneventful.  
- **Further Procedures:** Six weeks later, the patient underwent repair of the left popliteal aneurysm.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has a history of pulmonary embolus, a friable clot in the iliac veins, and a ruptured aneurysm. The treatment plan includes continued anticoagulation and surgical intervention for the aneurysms. The patient will continue to be monitored for any further complications or necessary interventions.
