**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:58 PM  

**Patient History:**

The patient has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, both managed by their primary care physician. In 2013, the patient suffered a traumatic lumbar fracture due to a fall and underwent surgery. CT scans at that time focused on the lumbar spine, with no contrast medium used. Retrospective observation of these CT scans revealed a partial inward deviation of the intimal calcification of the abdominal aorta, suggesting a localized dissection. The adventitia causing the aortic dissection was calcified, indicating a chronic aortic dissection predating the trauma. No aneurysm formation was noted in these scans.

In March 2020, the patient was admitted to the emergency department for vomiting, without abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis, receiving oral medication. A subsequent physical examination revealed a pulsating abdominal mass, leading to a consultation with the family doctor. An abdominal ultrasound examination resulted in a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient was referred for a contrast CT scan and a full workup of the AAA, and then to our hospital for urgent treatment due to the irregular nature of the aneurysm.

**Examination and Findings:**

Upon examination, a pulsating abdominal mass was detected without tenderness. Despite the irregular nature of the aneurysm, there were no findings suggestive of an infectious disease, such as fever or pain. Initial consideration was given to the possibility of an infectious aortic aneurysm. A screening test to locate the source of infection returned negative results, as did a subsequent blood culture.

**Plan:**

The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to monitor the condition and discuss further management options.
