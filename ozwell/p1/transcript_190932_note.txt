**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:25:46 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay but expresses nervousness about the test results.

**Objective:**  
- Abdominal ultrasound results indicate a right adrenal lesion measuring 9 cm in diameter.  
- The lesion is described as a soft tissue encapsulated mass of 10 x 9 cm in the right adrenal gland.  
- The patient is asymptomatic, and the physical examination was normal.

**Assessment:**  
- Right adrenal lesion identified.  
- Further evaluation is necessary to determine the nature of the lesion.

**Plan:**  
1. Conduct an endocrinological evaluation to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and check for hypersecretion of catecholamines.
2. Based on the endocrinological evaluation results:
   - If the mass is non-secreting, proceed with an adrenal scan for further information.
   - If the mass is secreting, perform additional tests to identify the specific hormones being secreted and determine the appropriate treatment.
3. Consider a laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy if surgical intervention is required. This procedure will involve inserting trocars into the abdomen and removing the mass through a small incision, with special care taken during dissection.
4. Schedule further tests and scans to ensure full preparation for potential surgery.
5. The patient is encouraged to bring family members to the next appointment for support.

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule the endocrinological evaluation and any necessary follow-up appointments.  
- Keep the patient informed throughout the process.  

**Patient Education:**  
- Discussed the routine nature of the potential surgical procedure and reassured the patient regarding the care that will be taken during the process.  
- Encouraged the patient to bring family for support during future appointments.
