**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reported experiencing episodes of chest pain in the past, but noted that this episode was different. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- High cholesterol  
- History of deep vein thrombosis  
- History of pulmonary embolism  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient was diagnosed with unstable angina, indicating a blockage in one of the coronary arteries, which could lead to a heart attack. A coronary angiography was performed, revealing a single coronary artery arising from the left coronary sinus with a 99% stenotic lesion in the left anterior descending artery beyond the first septal. Three right ventricular branches arose from the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery, with the largest branch crossing the right ventricular outflow tract and descending in the anterior right atrioventricular groove to anastomose with the distal right coronary artery. The diagonal artery had significant proximal stenosis, and the circumflex artery had severe proximal stenosis, giving rise to a large obtuse marginal branch and continuing in the posterior interventricular groove as the right coronary artery. The right coronary artery supplied the inferior surface of the right ventricle and anastomosed with the proximal right coronary artery arising anomalously from the left anterior descending artery. There was no stenotic lesion in this composite, anomalously arising proximal and distal right coronary arterial system.

The patient underwent urgent coronary artery bypass surgery. Intraoperative findings confirmed that the proximal right coronary artery was arising as a branch from the proximal left anterior descending artery after the first diagonal. The surgery was successful, and the patient is currently stable. Continuous monitoring and follow-up tests are planned.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will be monitored closely, and follow-up tests will be conducted to ensure recovery and manage any potential complications.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient was advised to report any new symptoms or concerns immediately.
