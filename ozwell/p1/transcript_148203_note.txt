**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Evaluation of an eruption on the right arm.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with an eruption on the right arm, first noticed approximately 6 months ago. The patient was previously treated with a short course of systemic antibiotics, which resulted in the enlargement and gradual extension of the lesions to the forearm, hand, and fingers. The patient denies any recent cat scratches and reports no fever.

**Past Medical History:**  
No previous illnesses or immunosuppressive drug use.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Multiple tender erythematous angiomatous papules and nodules in a grouped pattern on the extensor aspect of the right arm, extending distally, with varying sizes of 1 to 2 cm in diameter.
- Remainder of the skin is essentially normal, with no signs of blistering or erythematous background.
- Painful axillary lymphadenopathy noted.
- No mucous membrane lesions or hepatosplenomegaly observed.
- Severe pruritus and occasional bleeding in the papules reported.

**Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Routine laboratory blood tests and CD4 count were normal.
- ELISA tests for HIV were negative.
- No evidence of other immunosuppressive status from various systemic examinations.
- Histopathological examination showed an epidermal collaret with mild hyperkeratosis, focal parakeratosis, and crust formation. The vascular component in the upper dermis consisted of thin-walled vessels lined by plump cells, with deeper small and thick-walled vessels. Inflammatory cells included lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, with eosinophilic granular material present in some areas. Silver stain revealed a small number of bacilli-like organisms.

**Diagnosis:**  
Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA).

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Initial treatment with oral erythromycin was inadequate. 
- Second-line treatment with oral clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily was initiated.
- Doxepin 25 mg once daily was prescribed to control pruritus, resulting in significant improvement over a 3-month treatment period.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one month to monitor progress.

**Patient Education and Counseling:**  
The patient was advised to continue the prescribed medication regimen and to report any new symptoms or concerns. The patient was informed about the nature of the condition and the expected course of treatment.

**Next Steps:**  
Monitor the patient's response to the current treatment plan and adjust as necessary during the follow-up visit.
