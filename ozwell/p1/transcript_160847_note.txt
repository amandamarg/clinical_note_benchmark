**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and swelling above the right ankle joint and another swelling over the right iliac region for the past 6 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling above the right ankle joint and another swelling over the right iliac region for the past 6 months. The patient had a surgery 18 months ago for a swelling in the right leg, performed by a general orthopedic surgeon. The preliminary diagnosis before the surgery was a benign bone lesion, but no biopsy was done prior to the surgery. The surgery involved curettage of a lytic lesion in the distal tibia, and the surgical cavity was filled with autologous bone grafts harvested from the right iliac crest. Histopathology post-surgery revealed a benign giant cell tumor (GCT) of the distal tibia. After the surgery, the patient was in a below-knee plaster for 4 months. Two months post-plaster removal, the patient developed pain in the right leg above the ankle with gradually increasing swelling, and two weeks later, noticed another swelling over the right iliac crest with mild pain and discomfort.

**Medical History:**  
- Surgery 18 months ago for a lytic lesion in the distal tibia.
- Histopathology post-surgery revealed a benign GCT of the distal tibia.

**Clinical Findings:**  
- Patient was clinically anemic.
- Swelling over the anterolateral aspect of the distal part of the right leg with painful restricted ankle movements.
- Swelling over the right iliac region with mild to moderate tenderness on palpation at both sites.

**Diagnostic Imaging and Tests:**  
- X-rays: Lytic lesion in the distal tibia with ill-defined margins, no evidence of pathological fracture. Large soft tissue mass with irregularity of the bone over the outer table of the right iliac crest.
- MRI: Performed to delineate the extent of the tumor and its extension.
- Technetium-99 bone scan: Increased uptake around the distal tibia and focally in the ipsilateral iliac region only at the graft harvest site, no additional foci in the body.
- Core needle biopsy: Performed at both sites, histopathology revealed a benign GCT at both sites with identical picture.
- Computed tomography of the lungs: Normal.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has a benign giant cell tumor (GCT) at both the distal tibia and right iliac region. The condition requires close monitoring and regular check-ups to ensure it does not recur.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two months for monitoring and further evaluation.
