**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:24:41 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Fractured central incisors, high risk for caries, eccentric bruxism, partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant, multiple decay and fractured teeth.

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented with fractured central incisors but reported no pain or discomfort besides the fracture. The patient acknowledged experiencing teeth grinding at night, which may contribute to the fractured teeth.

**Objective:**  
- High risk for caries and eccentric bruxism noted.
- Partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant.
- Multiple decay and fractured teeth observed.

**Assessment:**  
- Conservative approach recommended to maintain the upper front teeth using composite fillings.
- Restoration of the posterior superior quadrants with implants advised.

**Plan:**  
- In 2017, the patient returned with pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine and new secondary subgingival caries in the six front teeth.
- Due to the poor conservative prognosis from subgingival decay, the patient opted for an implant-supported bridge to replace residual teeth, similar to previous posterior prostheses.
- Treatment was staged: lateral incisors extracted, two immediate implants placed, and four residual teeth prepared as abutments for a temporary bridge to maintain aesthetics and function during osseointegration.
- Subsequently, the four remaining teeth were extracted using SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by a second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one abutment tooth required root canal treatment due to a periapical infection.

**Outcome:**  
The patient eventually passed away. Further assistance to the family is offered during this time.
