**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Headaches

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing headaches for an extended period. An MRI scan revealed a giant aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery (ICA). Subsequent angiogram findings indicated a large para-ophthalmic aneurysm in the left ICA, measuring approximately 26x19 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm. There was no history of thunderclap headache or associated visual or neurologic symptoms. The angiogram also showed good collaterals with a patent anterior and posterior communicating (PCOM) artery.

**Treatment History:**  
The aneurysm was treated with parent vessel occlusion. A balloon occlusion test was performed prior to treatment, which was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge. Post-treatment, there was no antegrade flow in the left ICA. The angiogram of the left vertebral artery showed retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm. The aneurysm was expected to occlude over time due to competing antegrade intracranial flow. The patient remained asymptomatic after the treatment.

**Follow-Up:**  
Follow-up angiograms at 6 months and 2 years post-treatment showed no antegrade flow in the left ICA, but there was persistent filling of the left ICA aneurysm in a retrograde fashion through the PCOM artery. After another year of follow-up, there was no significant change in the size of the aneurysm. Due to the persistent filling of the aneurysm, the patient was transferred to our institution for further treatment.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient presents with a history of a large para-ophthalmic aneurysm in the left ICA, previously treated with parent vessel occlusion. Despite treatment, there is persistent retrograde filling of the aneurysm. Further evaluation and management are required to address the persistent aneurysm filling. The patient remains asymptomatic at this time. Further treatment options will be discussed with the patient.
