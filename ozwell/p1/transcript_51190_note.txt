**Chief Complaint:**  
Shortness of breath.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with shortness of breath that began approximately 5 months ago, preceded by a hoarse voice. The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) since 6 months of age. An endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed a mass of laryngeal papillomas causing airway narrowing. The patient was diagnosed with pediatric laryngeal papilloma type and upper airway obstruction.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) since 6 months old.
- Underwent tracheotomy and microscopic laryngeal surgery to clear papilloma mass.
- Requires surgery every 2 to 4 months.
- Has undergone tracheotomy 4 times.
- Total of 88 surgeries to date.
- Papilloma spread to bronchi since age 12.
- Maintains tracheocele to prevent laryngeal stenosis and facilitate bronchoscopy.

**Social History:**  
- Lives outside the city, far from the health center capable of performing necessary surgeries.

**Examinations and Tests:**  
- Final endoscopic examination: Papilloma implantation in trachea to proximal right main bronchi.
- HPV virus examination (PCR method): Presence of HPV type 11 infection in papilloma preparations.
- Histopathological examination: Squamous epithelium coated with papilloma with moderate dysplasia and koilocytosis.
- CT-scan of cervical-thoracic thorax: Laryngeal narrowing due to papilloma mass; papilloma growths in trachea to carina; nodules in right lung parenchyma.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient continues to experience complications from recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, with significant airway obstruction and papilloma spread. The current management includes regular surgical intervention to maintain airway patency and prevent further complications. Further monitoring and treatment adjustments may be necessary based on the progression of the disease and response to current interventions.
