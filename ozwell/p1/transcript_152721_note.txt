**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:24:23 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Referred by dentist for chronic ulcer.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a chronic ulcer in the right buccal mucosa adjacent to tooth number 18. The lesion has been present for approximately 6 months, increasing in size and causing discomfort. The patient is not on any medications and does not recall any trauma to the cheek.

**Clinical Examination:**  
- Large ulcer in the right buccal mucosa adjacent to tooth number 18, measuring approximately 4 and 5 cm with a grayish pink base and indurated margins.
- Tooth number 18 is buccally inclined and difficult to clean.
- No palpable lymph nodes.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Initial visit to the dentist 6 months ago for pain and discomfort in the region, diagnosed with temporomandibular joint pain on the right side and advised symptomatic treatment.
- Follow-up visit after 5 months led to a diagnosis of a chronic ulcer.

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Due to the chronicity and indurated margin of the ulcer, an excisional/incisional biopsy and removal of tooth number 18 were recommended, as the tooth could have been a causative factor for trauma.
- The patient opted for the procedure under general anesthetic.

**Procedure:**  
- Tooth number 18 was removed, providing good exposure of the ulcer.
- An excisional biopsy was performed with safety margins, and the area was sutured primarily.

**Postoperative Course:**  
- The postoperative period was uneventful, with the wound healing within 3 weeks without complications.

**Pathology Report:**  
- Microscopic examination revealed the extent of ulceration, with all sections presenting similar histologic features.

**Follow-Up:**  
- A follow-up of one year showed no recurrence or abnormalities.

**Recommendations:**  
- Maintain good oral hygiene.
- Report any future discomfort.
