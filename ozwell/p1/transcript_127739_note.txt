**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:32:45 PM  
**Clinic:** Neurology  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Unexplained events of syncope.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented to the Neurology clinic for evaluation of unexplained syncope. Over the past one to two years, the patient has experienced cognitive difficulties. Additionally, the patient reported an episodic right visual field event approximately six months ago, which raised concern for a possible retinal ischemic event. The patient has been followed closely by Ophthalmology and was found to have right-sided homonymous hemianopsia on exam, confirmed by a visual field test. A brain MRI did not show any clear lesion but revealed small multiple nonspecific white matter lesions and an asymmetrically larger posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle with more prominent atrophy of the left occipital lobe. The patient was not initially aware of the visual symptoms but later admitted to occasional difficulty seeing on the right side, although it does not significantly compromise daily activities. The patient's husband confirmed the absence of clear symptoms of right visual field deficit. Cognitive impairment was noted on bedside cognitive function tests, along with clear right visual field symptoms and corresponding left occipital area atrophy.

**Family History:**  
The patient's sister has progressive dementia.

**Radiology Report:**  
The formal report from Radiology did not mention hemi-atrophy in the occipital cortex, and no acute ischemic changes were evident.

**Ophthalmology Findings:**  
Right-sided homonymous hemianopsia confirmed by visual field test.

**Additional Testing:**  
The patient underwent further testing, including a nuclear medicine brain SPECT perfusion scan and a brain PET using the Florbetapir amyloid tracer, as part of a research protocol approved by the institutional IRB for the IDEAS trial. The Humphrey field plots, hemiatrophy of the visual cortex shown by CT and MRI, and the functional defect for the left occipital cortex all showed no differences.

**Plan:**  
Review test results and discuss the next steps with the patient.
