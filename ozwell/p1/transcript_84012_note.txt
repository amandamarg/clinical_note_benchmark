**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Generalized right knee pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing generalized right knee pain for several months. The pain is primarily localized to the right knee. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol consumption exceeding 400 mL of ethanol per week for the past 20 years. One year prior, the patient underwent a bipolar hip replacement for avascular necrosis of the left hip. There is no history of steroid intake or trauma.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Right knee joint: Physical examination revealed nothing remarkable.
- Right hip and left knee: Physical examination revealed no abnormality.

**Imaging and Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Radiographs of the right knee: No destruction of the articular surfaces, but increased radiodensity in the proximal half of the tibia extending from the joint line.
- MRI of the right knee: Large demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the proximal half of the tibia and medial femoral condyle, with features of osteonecrosis.
- Bone scintigram: Abnormal uptake in the right hip, and the right and left knee joints.
- Full blood screen including autoantibodies, clotting profile, ALP, and AMY: Normal results.
- HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses and antibodies: Negative.
- Radiographs of the right hip and left knee: Increased radiolucency.
- MRI of the right hip: Demarcated regions of abnormal signal intensity in the central portion of the right femoral head with typical features of osteonecrosis.
- MRI of the left knee: Multiple demarcated bone marrow abnormalities with double-line sign in the distal shaft of the left femur, compatible with bone necrosis.

**Assessment:**  
The patient presents with osteonecrosis in the right knee, right hip, and left knee, likely related to chronic alcohol consumption. There is a loss of bone density in the affected areas.

**Plan:**  
- Instruct the patient to maintain only partial weight-bearing with wheelchair mobilization for eight weeks, followed by a gradual return to full weight-bearing over the next two months.
- Follow-up appointment scheduled in two months.
- Eleven months after the initial presentation, the patient complained of mild pain in the right hip, and a plain radiograph revealed the collapse of the right femoral head. A bipolar hip arthroplasty was performed.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
The patient is advised to follow the weight-bearing instructions and take care of themselves. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two months to monitor progress.
