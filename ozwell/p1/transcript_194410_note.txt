**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:06:53 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling much better today. They initially presented with chest and back pain that had persisted for two weeks. The patient attempted to manage the pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which were ineffective.

**Objective:**  
Upon initial examination, the patient's vital signs were stable. The patient was conscious and able to move all limbs. A CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down to the level of the renal arteries. There was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with a large aneurysmal dilatation and compression of the true lumen. A large entry point was identified 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery.

**Assessment:**  
The findings indicated a serious condition requiring intervention. 

**Plan:**  
The patient underwent thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after admission, performed through the right femoral approach with the use of a stent graft. The intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. A postdeployment angiogram confirmed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point, with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries, as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries. The patient was discharged one day post-surgery and was doing well. Instructions on postoperative care and follow-up appointments will be provided to monitor the patient's condition. 

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will receive instructions on postoperative care and will be scheduled for follow-up appointments to ensure proper monitoring of their condition.
