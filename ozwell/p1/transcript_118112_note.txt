**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:24:58 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Large mass in left arm and shoulder  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a large mass in the left arm and shoulder. The mass began as a small swelling in the left upper arm three years ago. The patient was initially admitted to the hospital for excision but absconded due to fear of surgery. Subsequently, the patient sought treatment from bone setters, but the condition has progressively worsened over the past three years. The mass has become too large and heavy to manage, and the patient is facing social queries about the condition.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- A large mass is present in the left arm and shoulder.  
- There is a small wound on the posterior aspect of the tumour.  
- The tumour is pressing into the chest wall on the left side but is not causing dyspnoea.  
- There is a complete motor deficit with no power in the muscles of the forearm and hand.  

**Measurements and Tests:**  
- Tumour measurements: 32 cm long, 28 cm wide, and 87 cm in circumference.  
- X-Ray: Complete destruction of the upper half of the humerus with central calcification of the tumour mass.  
- CT Angiography: Extensive destruction of osseous tissue with calcification; involvement of the lateral aspect of the scapula. Normal blood flow in major vessels without undue hypervascularity in the tumour area. The tumour mass is pushing the thoracic cage inwards.  
- Radiographic skeletal survey and bone scan: No other lesions detected.  
- Biopsy: Confirmed diagnosis of Chondrosarcoma.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient has been diagnosed with Chondrosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, in the left arm and shoulder.  

**Plan:**  
- Perform a forequarter amputation with adequate margins to remove the bulky mass and clear the surrounding area of any suspected tumour mass.  
- Schedule the surgical procedure as soon as possible.  
- Address any questions or concerns the patient may have in the meantime.
