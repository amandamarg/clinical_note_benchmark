**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:39:02 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Severe headache for the past 6 months and recent loss of vision in the left eye.

**Medical History:**  
- Diagnosed with osteosarcoma 2 years ago.
- Underwent surgery to remove a bone tumor in the left temporal region.
- No follow-up appointments post-surgery due to pregnancy and childbirth.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Noted a 7-cm mass towards the left of the frontal bone.
- Mass is painful, with pain radiating along the orbital and maxillary branches of the left trigeminal nerve.
- Increase in size of the mass, possibly influenced by pregnancy hormones.
- Presence of multiple masses on the left side of the skull, including the anterior cranial fossa, orbit, base of the skull, and left part of the occipital region.

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
- Laboratory tests and family history are normal.
- Staging studies show no evidence of distant metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
- CT scan of the skull reveals a bone-forming non-lytic lesion with periosteal reaction.
- Lesion bulges outward towards the scalp, spreading into soft tissues and the entire left side of the skull with a sunburst pattern.
- Rims of the lesion are unsymmetrical and pointy, bulging into the left orbit outside the muscles, causing exophthalmos with semi-complete proptosis of the eyeball.
- Lesion applies pressure to the left frontal and temporal lobes, causing mild edema without invading brain tissue.
- Edema applies pressure to the left lateral ventricles, causing a minor shift of midline elements to the right side.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Due to the tumor's wide spread, a biopsy is recommended.
- Initiate treatment as soon as possible.
