**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Reason for Visit:** Regular checkup

**Findings:**

- **Initial Evaluation:** During the initial checkup, a small nodule was found in the patient's right lung. Laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative. No abnormalities were found during the physical examination.

- **CT Scan Results:** A CT scan revealed a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in the right lung. Biopsy samples were too small for a definitive diagnosis. There is a suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor, necessitating close observation.

- **Follow-up (Five Years Later):** A subsequent CT scan indicated a slight increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule and the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

- **Surgical Intervention:** Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed for the pulmonary lesion, and curettage of the lytic bone lesion was conducted. During surgery, the orthopedic surgeons noted that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. The vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.

- **Postoperative Progress:** The patient made good postoperative progress and has remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation. No significant findings were observed other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions, even with imaging examinations such as CT and MR imaging.

**Plan:** Continue monitoring the patient closely for any changes or developments. The patient is advised to contact the clinic with any concerns or questions.

**Conclusion:** The patient has shown good postoperative recovery and remains disease-free at this time. Further follow-up and monitoring are recommended to ensure continued health and well-being.
