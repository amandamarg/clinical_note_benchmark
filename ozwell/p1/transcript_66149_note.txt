**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:14:36 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Right foot injury due to road traffic accident.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reported to the hospital within two hours of sustaining a right foot injury in a road traffic accident. Upon examination, significant swelling and a wound were noted on the plantar aspect of the foot. Sensation and vascularity in the foot were normal.

**Examination and Findings:**  
Radiographs revealed dorsal dislocation of the first and second MTP joints with dorsal displacement of the sesamoid complex. Initial attempts at reduction using longitudinal traction and dorsally directed pressure over the head of the metatarsal through the wound, along with simultaneous plantar directed force on the base of the proximal phalanx in hyperextension and neutral position of the MTP joint, were unsuccessful.

Further investigation in the emergency OT under spinal anesthesia, approximately 12 hours post-injury, revealed the head of the first metatarsal protruding plantarwards through a rent in the plantar fascia with intact collateral ligaments. The lateral collateral ligament was divided, and a lever was placed dorsal to the proximal phalanx. Longitudinal traction and dorsal push were applied to the head of the metatarsal, achieving reduction of the 1st MTP joint. The sesamoid complex followed the proximal phalanx, but the 2nd MTP joint remained unreduced after an attempt at closed reduction. A lever was applied dorsal to the head of the 2nd metatarsal with longitudinal traction through the same wound to facilitate leverage out of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament lying dorsal.

**Plan and Follow-up:**  
The patient is instructed to rest the foot and keep it elevated as much as possible. Ice should be applied to reduce swelling, and pain medication should be taken as prescribed. The patient was advised to monitor for any changes and to follow up if there are any questions or concerns.

**Patient Acknowledgment:**  
The patient understood the instructions and had no further questions at this time.
