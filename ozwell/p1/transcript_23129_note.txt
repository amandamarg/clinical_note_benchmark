**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:37:16 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Occupation:** Housewife  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain and enlarging soft tissue mass in the left hand for 19 months  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the fifth finger of the left hand, which has been progressively worsening over the past 19 months. The patient also notes the presence of an enlarging soft tissue mass in the same finger. The patient recalls a minor trauma involving bruising of the finger in a door 14 months ago, for which she was referred to a neighboring clinic. Initial radiographs showed no fracture but revealed an abnormal calcifying lesion of the soft tissue of the left fifth finger. The patient has been treated with analgesics and splinting for more than 2 months, but the pain has gradually worsened.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Tenderness around the PIP joint of the fifth finger with an apparent subcutaneous tumor, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter.  
- Pain is elicited when the patient clenches her fist or when the lesion contacts another object.  
- No signs of infection or neurovascular disturbances.  
- No history of previous infection.  
- Range of motion of the affected PIP joint is slightly more restricted than that of the contralateral side, but there is no functional impairment of the finger.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Blood chemistry analysis shows no signs of inflammation or other abnormalities.  
- Radiographs taken 5 months prior revealed a well-defined calcified soft tissue mass overlying the ulnar side of the proximal and middle phalanges, well separated from the adjacent bone, with no periosteal reaction.  
- Radiographs at the time of presentation revealed an enlarged 2-humped calcifying lesion overlying the ulnar side of the PIP joint.  
- Computed tomography showed a well-defined and rimmed calcified lesion.

**Plan:**  
- Schedule a biopsy to further evaluate the lesion.  
- Follow-up appointment in one week to discuss biopsy results and treatment options.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
- Return in one week for biopsy results.  
- Contact the clinic if there are any questions or concerns before the follow-up appointment.
