**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mr. R.F.

**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Subjective:**
Mr. R.F. reports experiencing urinary frequency and dysuria, with a need to urinate every 1 to 2 hours, both day and night. He has a history of gross hematuria from February 2016 and is a 15 pack/year smoker. He underwent a CT scan at another medical center, which revealed a bladder tumor on the posterior wall. A transurethral resection of the papillary bladder tumor (TUR BT) was performed in March 2016, followed by a single postoperative dose of intravesical mitomycin C. The pathology report indicated a high-grade urothelial carcinoma invading the lamina propria, with no further invasion. Mr. R.F. did not receive any adjuvant therapy post-resection. He reports that anticholinergic medications have not improved his symptoms, and he has not had any recent urinary tract infections.

**Objective:**
- December 2016: Flexible cystoscopy revealed a denuded area on the posterior wall of the bladder with calcifications on the surface. Urine cytology was atypical.
- March 2017: Office cystoscopy showed no change, but urine cytology reported high-grade cancer.
- October 2017: Flexible cystoscopy and urine cytology were performed. Abnormal appearing concretions were observed on the denuded urothelium on the posterior wall, and urine cytology was again positive for high-grade cancer.

**Assessment:**
Mr. R.F. presents with persistent urinary frequency and dysuria following TUR BT for high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The presence of abnormal concretions and positive urine cytology for high-grade cancer suggests the need for further treatment.

**Plan:**
- Refer Mr. R.F. to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment options for bladder cancer.
- Advise Mr. R.F. to make an appointment with the specialist and keep updated on his progress.
