**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:35:18 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient, a three-year-old male, initially presented with two weeks of right facial nerve paralysis, gait disturbance, and difficulty swallowing. He was subsequently presented in an unconscious condition.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
A CT scan revealed a well-defined lesion with an area of calcification in the right cerebellum, a right to left shift of the fourth ventricle, and severe obstructive hydrocephalus.

**Intervention and Outcome:**  
Following a shunting procedure, the patient regained full consciousness. A further neurological examination revealed paralysis of the right facial nerve, right-sided dysmetria and dysdiadokokinesia, neck stiffness, and nystagmus. Deep reflexes were increased bilaterally, but there was no papilledema. No cutaneous lesions or significant family history were noted.

A diagnosis of right cerebellar tumor was made, and surgical removal was performed three days after the shunting procedure. Post-surgery, the patient made an uneventful recovery. The facial nerve paralysis remained, but swallowing difficulties were reduced. On discharge, the patient was able to walk, albeit with some instability, and had no difficulty swallowing.

**Follow-Up:**  
Over the following six-month period, there was complete resolution of all neurological deficits except for very mild paralysis of the right facial nerve. A control MRI three months post-surgery revealed total tumor removal, and the brain stem had resumed almost normal size and position.

**Pathology Report:**  
The section of the tumor mass revealed relatively well-preserved cerebellar architecture with widened and distorted folia. There was diffuse enlargement of the molecular and internal granular layers, filled with dispersed ganglionic cells of varying sizes.

**Current Status:**  
The patient is currently doing well.

**Plan:**  
Follow-up requirements will be instructed.
