**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Constipation and weight loss for 3 months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a 3-month history of constipation and weight loss. Initial evaluation with an x-ray abdomen and CT-Scan of the abdomen revealed multiple air fluid levels and a circumferential growth involving the sigmoid colon with impending perforation. Small loculated collections were noted reaching the superior border of the urinary bladder and uterus, extending to the lateral abdominal wall, suggesting micro abscesses.

**Procedures and Findings:**  
- **Gastroscopy and Colonoscopy:** Colonoscopy was inconclusive due to narrowing proximal to the sigmoid colon.
- **Exploratory Laparotomy and Sigmoid Colectomy:** Findings included an exophytic sigmoid colon tumor proliferating extraluminally with small bowel adhesions. The tumor was adherent to the lateral pelvic abdominal wall with a subcutaneous abscess pocket. Tumor perforation in the sigmoid colon with minimal contamination was noted. The tumor infiltrated the lateral wall of the uterus. No ascites, lymphadenopathy, or free peritoneal/omental deposits were observed.

**Histopathology Report:**  
Moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a single sclerosed lymph node suggesting tumor metastasis with foreign body giant cell reaction.

**Further Evaluation:**  
Evaluations by gynecology and urology departments for a possible primary source of malignancy in the urogenital tract were negative. No skin lesions or ulcers were present to suggest a skin primary source.

**Postoperative Course:**  
The patient recovered well from surgery with parental nutrition support and was ambulatory on the 7th postoperative day. However, a subsequent CT Scan of the abdomen showed a small fluid collection at the site of surgical anastomosis with few air pockets suggesting abscess formation/leakage. Concomitant ascites, pleural effusion, and a liver lesion were also noted.

**Treatment:**  
Wound infection was initially treated with regular dressings, followed by vacuum dressing. After improvement in health, enteral nutrition, and wound condition, the patient was discharged for follow-up in 2 weeks.

**Outcome:**  
Unfortunately, the patient passed away at home. The CT Scan had shown complications, and despite treatment efforts, the patient succumbed to the condition. My deepest condolences to the family for their loss.
