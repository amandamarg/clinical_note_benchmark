**Objective:**  
- Diagnosis: Middle esophageal diverticulum.  
- Examination: Accumulation of contrast medium in the diverticulum noted during initial examination.  
- Surgery: Thoracoscopic diverticulectomy performed. The diverticulum measured 47 mm in diameter.  
- Findings: The diverticulum mucous membrane was partially covered by adherent white matter, unstained with iodine. Narrowband imaging revealed type A.  
- Biopsy: Pathological findings of the endoscopic biopsy showed atypical epithelium with no malignant findings.  
- Esophageal Function: Lower esophageal sphincter function confirmed, and normal esophageal body peristaltic wave observed using high-resolution manometry.

**Assessment:**  
The atypical epithelium suggested the possibility of malignancy, prompting the decision to proceed with surgery. No malignant findings were observed during the procedure.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the patient's recovery and ensure proper healing.  
- Schedule follow-up appointments to check on progress.  
- The patient is advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
