**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and lesion with purulent discharge.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient, a [patient's age]-year-old male, presented with a dull ache in the right upper quadrant for one week. The patient reported nausea but denied fever. A lesion in the same area was noted, producing a white, purulent discharge.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Liver abscess operation 15 years ago.  
- No chronic illnesses reported.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Tenderness in the right upper quadrant abdominal wall.  
- Fistula opening with white fluid discharge observed in the lesion.

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
- Abdominal ultrasonography: Cystic mass (6 cm diameter) in the seventh and eighth segment of the liver with a calcified membrane and comet-tail artifact indicating air presence. The lesion protruded to the subcapsular area and subcutaneous tissue, suggesting a fistula. Biochemical values and complete blood counts were within normal limits.
- Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast: Single, calcified, membranous lesion in segments 8 and 4A with a fistula to the abdominal anterior wall. Increased subcutaneous density within the cyst noted.

**Treatment and Hospital Course:**  
- Surgical drainage via subcostal incision under local anesthesia, draining approximately 100 mL of purulent material.  
- Due to advanced age, the cyst was not excised.  
- Postoperative complications included bradycardia and hypoglycemia, necessitating admission to the intensive care unit.  
- Analysis of purulent material: Negative for Echinococcus infection; Klebsiella pneumonia cultured, susceptible to most commonly used antibiotics.  
- Initiated a 14-day course of ampicillin-sulbactam.  
- Repeated abdominal ultrasonography showed no recurrence of similar cystic lesions.  
- Discharged 7 days after hospitalization.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up evaluations to ensure proper healing.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence or complications.  
- Complete the prescribed antibiotic course.  
- Schedule follow-up appointments for further evaluation.
