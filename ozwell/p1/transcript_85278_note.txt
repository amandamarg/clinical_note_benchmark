**Patient History:**  
The patient was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a mass on the mitral valve, initially identified by chest radiography in 2008. Transthoracic echocardiography at that time revealed a calcified and immobile mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. The patient's past medical history includes pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 6 and systemic hypertension. There is no history of infectious endocarditis, chest trauma, or thrombus formation due to a hypercoagulable state. Differential diagnoses considered were calcified cardiac fibroelastoma and myxoma. Surgical treatment was offered due to the potential risk of a thromboembolic event, but the patient refused. The patient was managed on an outpatient basis with periodic transthoracic echocardiographic evaluations every 6 months.

In March 2011, the patient reported chest discomfort and was admitted to our hospital in October 2011. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a calcified mass measuring 19 Ã— 8 mm located between the P2 and P3 areas of the posterior mitral valve leaflet, with no mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 67%. There were no findings suggestive of infectious endocarditis. Cardiac catheterization revealed intact coronary arteries without an obvious thrombo-occlusive lesion. Computed tomograms confirmed the severe calcified mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. Laboratory examinations were unremarkable.

Due to the potential risk of thromboembolism, surgical intervention was indicated for the calcified mass or tumor on the mitral valve. The patient underwent surgical removal of the mass with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. The mitral valve was inspected through a right-sided left atrial incision, and the entire mass was excised and submitted for histopathological examination.
