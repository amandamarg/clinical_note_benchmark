**Patient Information:**

**Chief Complaint:**
Pain and swelling behind the left knee.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling behind the left knee, which began approximately four days ago. The patient has difficulty walking short distances due to pain in the left calf and a reduced range of movement in the knee. The patient was admitted to the medical specialty ward last week with a diagnosis of a spontaneous haematoma behind the thigh, attributed to warfarin use for atrial fibrillation. No history of trauma was reported.

**Past Medical History:**
- Atrial fibrillation (on warfarin)
- Prostate cancer (undergoing treatment)
- Hypertension
- Recent coccygectomy for metastasis
- Permanent pacemaker insertion for syncopal episodes and bradycardia

**Social History:**
- Non-smoker
- Resides in a retirement home

**Family History:**
- No family history of aneurysms

**Review of Systems:**
- Reports feeling frail and weak, requiring assistance with some activities at home.

**Physical Examination:**
- Extensive bruising at the back of the left thigh and knee.
- Palpable femoral and pedal pulses.
- Difficult to palpate popliteal pulse due to large haematoma.
- Left foot viable with fully intact sensory and motor function.
- No evidence of calf compartment syndrome in the left leg.
- Right foot warm with all palpable pulses in the leg.

**Imaging:**
- Ultrasound scan and CT angiogram revealed a ruptured 9.4 cm popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) involving only the above-knee popliteal artery with relatively disease-free 3-vessel runoff to the ankle and foot.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with a ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm, complicated by frailty and multiple comorbidities. Given the patient's condition, endovascular treatment with a stent graft is deemed feasible and appropriate.

**Plan:**
- Schedule endovascular procedure for PAA.
- Provide instructions for procedure preparation.
- Continue current medications.
- Emphasize the importance of follow-up appointments.
