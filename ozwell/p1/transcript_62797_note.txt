**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing severe pain in the left knee following a twisting injury to the left foot during aerobics. The patient was nonambulatory upon arrival at the emergency room.

**Objective:**  
- Physical examination revealed a patella dislocation with the patella palpated laterally and the knee locked at 20 degrees of flexion. The patient experienced significant pain upon attempting to move the knee.
- Radiographs confirmed a lateral patellar dislocation with an avulsion fracture of the anterior medial border of the patella.
- No history of previous patellar subluxation, instability, or hypermobility was reported.

**Assessment:**  
Lateral patellar dislocation with associated avulsion fracture and incarceration in the lateral patellar retinaculum.

**Plan:**  
- Initial pain management included local anesthetic injection, intravenous analgesia, and conscious sedation.
- Multiple attempts to reduce the patella in the emergency room were unsuccessful.
- Percutaneous manipulation using bone reduction forceps under sterile conditions was also unsuccessful.
- The patient was taken to the operative room for reduction under general anesthesia with complete muscle relaxation, which was unsuccessful.
- A 2 cm incision was made along the lateral border of the patella, revealing incarceration in the lateral patellar retinaculum and locking against the lateral femoral condyle. The patella was reduced with minimal effort after releasing the incarcerated lateral tissues.
- The incision was closed, and a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed, revealing trauma to the lateral femoral condyle and an 11 mm free-floating chondral fragment in the medial gutter.
- The articular surface of the knee was inspected.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient will require monitoring to assess healing progress. Physical therapy and follow-up appointments will be necessary to ensure proper recovery.
