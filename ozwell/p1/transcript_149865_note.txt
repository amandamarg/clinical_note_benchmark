**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:18:34 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Type 2 Diabetes (diagnosed 5 years ago)  
- **Previous Surgical History:** Locking distal tibial plate and distal fibular plate placement 3 years ago in UAE  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Non-healing ulcer on the right leg  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a non-healing ulcer on the right leg, persisting for approximately one year. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, diagnosed 5 years ago. Previous non-operative management at other hospitals has not improved symptoms. The patient expresses a desire to have the implant removed, despite being informed of potential difficulties.  

**Previous Attempt at Implant Removal:**  
A failed attempt to remove the implant occurred 6 months ago at another hospital. During that procedure, one of the 5 proximal locking screws was removed using a standard screwdriver. The remaining screws were stripped, and attempts to remove them using the AO Synthes screw extraction kit and conical extraction screw were unsuccessful.  

**Current Procedure:**  
Due to the unavailability of a carbide drill, a new technique was employed. Stainless steel metal cutting blades, typically used for cutting door locks or pad locks, were used to cut the remaining stripped headed screws. A space was created between the locking plate and bone using a sharp osteotome. An autoclaved iron cutting blade was introduced between the plate and bone to cut the remaining screws with a to and fro motion. The threaded parts of the screws were left in the bone to avoid further weakening. The procedure took 10 minutes, with no heating issues during the cutting process.  

**Plan:**  
The implant has been successfully removed. The patient will be monitored for progress, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks to assess the patient's condition.
