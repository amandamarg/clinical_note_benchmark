**Chief Complaint:**  
- Numbness, shrinkage, and weakness on the left side of the face.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports that they underwent an adenotonsillectomy at the age of 6. Three months post-surgery, the patient began experiencing numbness on the left side of the face. The operating doctor was informed but reported no issues. Over the next two years, the patient noticed an increase in numbness, along with shrinkage and weakness on the left side of the face. Due to socioeconomic reasons, the patient was unable to seek further medical attention at that time. 

**Physical Examination at Referral:**  
- Atrophy of cutaneous and subcutaneous fat tissue on the left side of the face.

- Displacement of the left upper teeth in an upward and backward direction.  
- No dermal lesions or involvement of extremities.

**Family History:**  
- No family history of Parry-Romberg Hemifacial Atrophy (PHA).

**Previous Interventions:**  
- Autologous fat injection at ages 14 and 16, which did not sustain the desired result, and atrophy continued.

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
- Serological tests: No antibodies detected.  
- Sedimentation and core reactive protein levels: Within normal limits.  
- Computed Tomography (CT): No apparent neurodegeneration, ruling out Rasmussen encephalitis. Decrease in left retroorbital fat tissue and atrophy of the ocular bulb. Left temporal muscle atrophic compared to the right.  
- Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA): No vascular abnormalities of the internal and external carotid arteries or their branches.

**Plan:**  
Further tests are required to determine the underlying cause of the symptoms. The patient will be scheduled for additional diagnostic evaluations.
