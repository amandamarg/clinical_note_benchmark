**Time:** 8:33:52 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Abdominal mass

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with a history of an abdominal mass that has been present for 7 years. The mass has been increasing in size and causing discomfort and a sense of heaviness. The patient denies any pain associated with the mass. There is no history of trauma or surgeries, and no other swelling has been noted. The patient has not experienced any constitutional symptoms.

**Physical Examination:**  
- **Location of Mass:** Lower left side of the abdomen  
- **Size of Mass:** Approximately 15 by 13 cm  
- **Characteristics of Mass:** Soft, mobile, non-pulsatile, and non-tender  
- **Skin Examination:** No signs of infection or skin abnormalities  
- **Abdominal Examination:** No hernias noted

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
- Blood work: Within normal limits  
- MRI abdomen with contrast: Revealed the mass to be subcutaneous fat tissue with no underlying mass or abdominal enhancement to suggest liposarcoma.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has been admitted to the surgical ward for surgical excision of the abdominal mass. Consent for the surgery has been obtained. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. The patient will be placed in a supine position on the operating table, and the abdomen will be prepared and draped in the standard sterile manner. A lower abdominal incision will be made 8 cm from the root of the penis and extended to the level of the anterior superior iliac spine bilaterally. The abdominal flap will be undermined to a level just above the rectus fascia. Upon reaching the umbilicus, it will be freed from the raised abdominal flap, and the flap will be raised to the level of the costal margin. The mass, found to be diffused and arising from the subcutaneous tissue with no definite capsule, will be completely resected along with the excess abdominal skin. Hemostasis will be secured, and two suction drains will be inserted and brought out through the pubic area.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored post-operatively, and any questions or concerns will be addressed as needed.
