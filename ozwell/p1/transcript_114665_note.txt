**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Age:** 20  
**Gender:** [Patient's Gender]  
**Chief Complaint:** Painful swelling on the left thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a painful swelling on the left thigh, which began after being kicked by a friend. The pain is described as sharp and worsens with leg movement. Initial plain radiography revealed a concentric cystic lesion with cortical thinning and ballooning in the mid-portion of the femoral shaft, accompanied by a pathologic fracture. The patient underwent curettage of the cystic bone lesion and autogenous bone grafting, followed by open reduction and internal fixation for the pathologic fracture. A biopsy confirmed a unicameral bone cyst. Post-surgery, the patient was under close observation, and the plate was removed two years later upon complete healing of the cystic bone lesion. Initially, a 1.5 cm femoral shortening was noted, which increased to a 3.5 cm discrepancy with age, resulting in abnormal gait and posture. Lengthening of the shortened femur was planned.

At the age of 20, the patient reported recurrence of pain in the left thigh. Subsequent plain radiography and MRI scan revealed a 6.6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm-sized, well-defined cystic lesion in the left distal femur, with a linear pathologic fracture and periosteal reaction. Treatment involved curettage and autogenous bone grafting combined with internal fixation using an intramedullary nail. One year post-surgery, the lesion was stabilized despite cortical thinning and ballooning of the femur.

**Assessment:**  
1. Recurrent unicameral bone cyst in the left femur with pathologic fracture.
2. Leg length discrepancy of 3.5 cm resulting in abnormal gait and posture.

**Plan:**  
- Continue regular follow-up appointments to monitor the stability of the lesion and overall bone health.
- Address the leg length discrepancy with planned femur lengthening in the near future.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to ensure ongoing monitoring and management of the condition.
