**Chief Complaint:**  
Right facial swelling.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with right facial swelling that began after experiencing a shock on the right cheek while operating a construction vehicle. The patient reported initial bleeding from the skin of the right cheek, which ceased after applying pressure. A few days later, the patient developed swelling on the right side of the face and experienced slight trismus. The patient visited a dental office, was prescribed antibiotics, and referred to our department. 

**Past Medical History:**  
- Positive for hepatitis C virus.
- Liver cirrhosis.
- Hepatocellular carcinoma treated by radiofrequency ablation.
- Impaired liver function with a Child Pugh B score.
- Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.
- No esophageal varices observed.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
- Panorama and posteroanterior X-ray examination revealed a small radiopaque foreign body at the lateral aspect of the right mandibular ramus.
- CT examination indicated the foreign body was located under the masseter muscle and was not palpable from the surface of the face or the oral mucosa.

**Previous Plan:**  
The removal of the foreign body was planned after symptom improvement with medications. However, the patient did not return for the follow-up appointment.

**Recent Developments:**  
In 2008, the patient experienced strong traction on the right side of the face when approaching an MRI scanner for a brain image examination, recalling the presence of the foreign body. The MRI examination was contraindicated as the foreign body was shown to be ferromagnetic.

**Current Plan:**  
Due to the necessity of MRI examination to evaluate the patient's condition, the removal of the foreign body is reconsidered. The patient has agreed to proceed with the removal. The procedure will be scheduled, and the patient is advised to follow all given instructions closely.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be strictly followed due to their medical conditions and the need for MRI evaluation.

**Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to take care of themselves and adhere to all medical instructions provided.
