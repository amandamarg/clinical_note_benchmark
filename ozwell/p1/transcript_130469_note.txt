**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:28:04 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Sudden-onset back pain for the past three days.  
- **Medical History:** Hypertension.  

**Clinical Findings:**  
- The patient reports experiencing sharp pain in the lower back.  
- A Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan in the arterial phase was performed, revealing an aneurysm in the descending aorta with a diameter of 64 mm.  
- Another medical center detected an impending aneurysm rupture in the descending aorta.  

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- The patient was referred to the emergency department for evaluation of the back pain.  
- After evaluation in the cardiovascular surgery and invasive radiology joint council, an emergent surgical intervention is planned to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.  
- The planned procedure is an endovascular repair of the descending aortic aneurysm.  
- Due to the character of the back pain, both carotid arteries will be occluded, and bypass operations will be performed to avoid potential ischemia.  
- An extra-anatomic bypass will be performed instead of median sternotomy due to the presence of an ascending aortic aneurysm.  
- To avoid potential brain ischemia, the ECA will be used for the donor artery if calibration is appropriate.  
- To prevent arm ischemia, bypass operations will be conducted first.  
- The procedure will take place in a specific operating room designed for diagnostic and interventional procedures using radiation.  

**Plan:**  
- Proceed with the planned surgical interventions as outlined.  
- Ensure all necessary precautions are taken to provide the best care during the surgery.
