**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:10:17 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Gravida:** 3  
- **Para:** 0  
- **Gestational Age:** 34 weeks and 4 days  
- **History:** Septate uterus for 6 years, medical abortion with misoprostol 6 and 3 years ago  
- **Social History:** No history of smoking, alcoholic beverage consumption, or drug abuse during pregnancy  
- **Family History:** No hereditary anomalies identified  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Premature rupture of membranes and threat of premature labor for 9 hours.

**Emergency Room Visit:**  
The patient presented with premature rupture of membranes and a threat of premature labor. A cesarean section was performed.

**Neonate Information:**  
- **Apgar Score:** 10 at 1 minute, 10 at 5 minutes  
- **Findings:** An amniotic band was observed, consisting of a layer of annular amniotic tissue approximately 1 cm wide, tightened around the upper third of the right upper limb. The distal limb displayed cyanoderma, edema of the extremity, and focal peeling, with no autonomous activities or reactions of tenderness. X-ray showed negative results for the humerus but clear swelling of the soft tissues.

**Intervention:**  
During the operation, the space between the amniotic band and upper limb skin was carefully separated, and the band was cut off directly. The neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.

**Postoperative Course:**  
Four hours post-operation, the swelling of the right limb was further aggravated, the radial artery could not be reached, and the local skin color did not improve. The possibility of further necrosis of the limb and local toxin absorption leading to the death of the neonate was considered. An amputation of the upper third of the right upper extremity was performed. The patient was relatively stable during anesthesia and successfully underwent surgery. There were no severe complications after the operation. The incision was almost healed without infection, dehiscence, or other complications, as observed by postoperative X-ray images. The neonate recovered rapidly and was discharged 9 days after surgery.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the neonate's recovery and provide necessary support and follow-up care.
