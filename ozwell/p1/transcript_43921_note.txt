**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History:** The patient has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently in remission, and ureteral stone causing hydronephrosis. The patient is a smoker and has a history of drug abuse. There is no history of diabetes, alcoholism, or other general medical conditions.

**Presenting Complaint:**
- The patient presented with a puncture wound on the right leg, which has been swelling and turning red.

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient sustained a puncture wound three days ago after falling off a bike and hitting the leg on the metal pedal. The patient has been in the hospital for three days and has been taking antibiotics. A surgical team was consulted for wound debridement, and the diagnosis was confirmed as necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A streptococcal organisms. Surgical debridement took place over the span of one week, resulting in an open wound on the right posterior leg. After negative pressure wound therapy, the patient was referred to UC Davis Medical Center for reconstruction.

**Examination and Procedures:**
- Upon transfer to UC Davis Medical Center, the patient was immediately prepared for free-tissue transfer. During the procedure, a line was drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lateral border of the patella. The skin vessels supplying the ALT flap are centered along this line, or slightly lateral of it. A handheld Doppler was used to localize the skin perforators in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Examination of the foot revealed that the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels were palpable and normal.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring the wound healing process and ensure proper care and management of the free-tissue transfer site. Follow up on the patient's smoking and drug abuse history to provide appropriate support and interventions.
