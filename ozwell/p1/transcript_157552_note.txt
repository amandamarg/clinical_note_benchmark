**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:38:30 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient presented with intermittent abdominal pain lasting for a few hours over the past three months. A computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the lower abdomen and pelvic cavity, suggesting a borderline or malignant ovarian neoplasm. No ascites or metastatic lymphadenopathy were found.

The patient has a history of nephrectomy for a Wilms' tumor 25 years ago. Post-surgery, the patient was treated with intravenous dactinomycin for 5 days and vincristine on the 7th day. The patient has been healthy with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis until the recent abdominal pain noted in September 2009.

Under the clinical diagnosis of an ovarian tumor, a pelvic mass resection was performed in February 2010. Intraoperative findings showed the mass occupied the entire lower abdominal cavity without involving both adnexa. Intraoperative consultation suggested a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor or other malignant mesenchymal tumor like leiomyosarcoma.

The original slides of the Wilms' tumor were unavailable for review. The outside pathology report indicated the tumor was 12 cm, located at the right kidney, and abutting the head of the pancreas. The operation record noted incomplete excision of the tumor. Microscopically, it was a classic Wilms' tumor with predominant epithelial tubular elements and minor blastemal and mesenchymal components. No anaplasia or lymphovascular invasion was recorded, and the mitotic count was scant.

**Plan:**  
Further evaluation and treatment are necessary. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to discuss the next steps.
