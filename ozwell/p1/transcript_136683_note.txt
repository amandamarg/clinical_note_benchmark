**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:42:34 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presents with chronic abdominal pain and a foreign body sensation. The patient has a history of an incisional hernia repair with mesh in 2010 and a right hemicolectomy for benign colonic polyps in March of the same year. Post hernia repair, the patient developed an incisional hernia and reports sharp pain in the epigastric area, particularly when bending forward, along with a fullness in the upper abdominal region.

**Objective:**  
During the general surgery clinic assessment, a focused abdominal exam revealed a midline laparotomy incision with no acute signs of infection. There was noted fullness superior to the umbilicus and a palpable subcutaneous mass measuring approximately 6 cm in diameter. Cross-sectional imaging showed an ovoid collection in the anterior abdominal wall, measuring 4.4 × 8 cm on MRI and 3.3 × 5.4 cm on CT, with abnormal calcification superior to the collection on CT.

**Assessment:**  
Findings suggest a chronic hematoma and scar tissue.

**Plan:**  
The patient agreed to undergo debridement of the chronic hematoma and partial mesh excision. During the procedure, a midline incision was made to approach the ovoid collection. A thick rind of scar and fibrous tissue measuring about 8 × 8 cm was encountered. The old hematoma and fibrous tissue were expressed after unroofing. Part of the overlying Prolene mesh and thick scar tissue was excised, while the remainder of the Prolene mesh, which was well incorporated to the fascia, was left in place. A piece of calcified tissue suspected to be heterotopic ossification was removed from the preperitoneal space superior to the mesh. The fascia was repaired, and the incision was closed.

The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor recovery.
