**Time:** 8:07:19 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]  
- **Age:** [Patient's Age]  
- **Gender:** Male  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and swelling on the right cheek for three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling on the right cheek for the past three months. He has been taking analgesics and antibiotics, but the symptoms have worsened.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history or known allergies.

**Surgical History:**  
- Underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery a year and a half ago in a local hospital. The postoperative period was uneventful.

**Relevant Surgical Information:**  
- During the surgery, a dislodged orthodontic appliance was identified in the right cheek. The molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing and confirmed to be high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area on a postoperative X-ray taken the next day. Further postoperative radiographs confirmed its location outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to pronounced postoperative facial oedema, no attempt was made to remove the appliance. The absence of signs and symptoms during follow-up sessions led to the decision to leave it in-situ with continuous clinical observation.

**Examination Findings:**  
- A sinus with slight pus discharge was noted on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar. All teeth in that quadrant were firm and vital. Tenderness was elicited upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region.

**Assessment:**  
- Suspected that the sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue.

**Plan:**  
- Further tests are needed to confirm the suspicion. The patient was informed about the potential need to remove the appliance to prevent further complications. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to discuss test results and any necessary procedures.
