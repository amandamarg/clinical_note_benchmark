**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They have a significant medical history, including a kidney transplant in 2013, for which they have been on immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus. The patient also has a history of end-stage renal disease and underwent 11 years of hemodialysis. Recently, the patient experienced an ischemic stroke and an accidental fall at home, resulting in trauma to the left wrist. They were admitted to the hospital for a hematoma on the left forearm.

**Objective:**  
During the initial hospitalization, the patient underwent surgical revision of the hematoma and ligation of the distal radial artery. A left wrist radiogram revealed an area of diaphyseal osteolysis of the radius surrounded by voluminous soft-tissue swelling. Subsequently, the radial artery required ligation right after its origin from the brachial artery due to an enlarging hematoma. The patient was readmitted to the emergency department for active bleeding from the surgical site, necessitating urgent evacuation of the hematoma. The specific source of the hematoma was undetectable, and hemostasis was achieved using surgical glue devices. A surgical reduction of the brachial artery's diameter was also performed. The hospitalization was complicated by two events of severe anemia, requiring blood transfusions.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was readmitted to the department due to chronic anemia and worsening of the forearm lesion. A Doppler ultrasound was performed, but further imaging with computed tomography was required for detailed characterization of the mass.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be closely monitored with regular check-ups. Medications will be prescribed to help improve the patient's condition. Further treatment will be based on ongoing assessments and imaging results.
