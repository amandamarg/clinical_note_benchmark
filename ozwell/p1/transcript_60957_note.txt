**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:09:55 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Condition:** Severe depression, obesity, diabetes  
- **Recent Event:** Prolonged seizure stopped by intravenous benzodiazepine  

**Discussion:**  
The patient has been experiencing severe depression and recently had a prolonged seizure, which was managed with intravenous benzodiazepine. The patient is also obese and has diabetes. We discussed the potential relationship between diabetes and epilepsy, noting that while the fundamental mechanisms remain debated, hypoglycemia is a recognized cause of seizures in young epilepsy patients. During the patient's ECT, elevated blood sugar levels were observed, but a decline in blood sugar levels the previous night and fasting before ECT could not be ruled out as contributing factors. However, the likelihood of a prolonged seizure due to reduced blood and brain glucose levels is considered low, as significant hypoglycemia is required for such seizures, which are rare.

Despite the patient's obesity, no changes in respiratory function were noted during ECT. Obesity can be a risk factor for altered respiration, particularly concerning upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), which increases the risk of anesthesia-related adverse events. However, the patient does not present with any sleep-related respiratory disorders.

**Plan:**  
The patient's condition will be monitored closely, and a follow-up appointment is scheduled for next week.

**Patient Queries:**  
The patient did not have any additional questions or concerns at this time.
