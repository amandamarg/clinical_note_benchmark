**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:36:15 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Missing teeth  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presents with missing teeth and reports uncoordinated mandibular movements due to a neurological disorder. The patient also experiences restricted mouth opening, measured at 15-20 mm.

**Examination:**  
During the examination, a high arched palate was observed, complicating the process of making conventional dental impressions.

**Plan:**  
To address the challenges presented by the patient's condition, a customized balloon impression tray will be used. The stock tray was modified by reducing the height of the flanges and removing the palatal part of the tray. A flat acrylic palatal plate was attached using auto-polymerizing resin, and a latex balloon was affixed to the flat palatal plate. The balloon's outlet was connected to a clinical sphygmomanometer bulb via a rubber pipe to facilitate air passage and inflation. In the case of a latex allergy, a nonlatex balloon will be used. The tray assembly is prepared for recording the impression with a minimal amount of addition polysiloxane impression material loaded onto the tray. The tray will be positioned inside the oral cavity without applying pressure toward the palate, and the balloon will be inflated to capture the impression.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to return if any issues arise in the future.
