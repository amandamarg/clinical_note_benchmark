**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:27:02 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Fatigue and shortness of breath for the past six months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports feeling tired and experiencing shortness of breath over the last six months. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing dull pain in the right upper stomach.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Tachycardia at rest  
- Hepatomegaly  

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- **Chest X-ray:** Clear lung fields, slightly enlarged heart.  
- **Abdominal Ultrasound:** A few cysts in the liver, no associated lymphadenopathy in the coeliac group of lymph nodes.  
- **CT Scan (Abdomen, Chest, Brain):** One cyst in the heart, four cysts in the liver, no cysts in the lungs or brain.  
- **Serology Test (ELISA for Hydatid Cyst):** Positive  

**Assessment:**  
The presence of cystic lesions in multiple organs, particularly the heart and liver, along with positive serology for Hydatid Cyst, confirms the diagnosis of Hydatid Cyst disease.

**Plan:**  
- The patient is scheduled for urgent open-heart surgery due to the risk of potential rupture of the cardiac cyst and its grave consequences.  
- Surgical procedure will involve conventional median sternotomy, aortocaval cannulation, aortic cross-clamp, and cardioplegic heart arrest.  
- The cardiac cyst is located intramurally in the interventricular septum, expanding mostly to the left side of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and partly crossing to the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle.  
- The myocardium overlying the cyst is fibrosed, forming part of the ectocyst wall. The most epicardially prominent part of the cyst will be the site of aspiration and incision.  

**Postoperative Care:**  
- The patient will need to rest and attend follow-up appointments to monitor recovery and ensure no complications arise.

**Instructions to Patient:**  
- Rest and follow postoperative care instructions.  
- Attend scheduled follow-up appointments for monitoring and further management.
