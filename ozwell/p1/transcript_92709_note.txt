**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:06:35 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital 10 months ago with symptoms of epigastric pain, fatigue, weight loss, and jaundice. The patient reported significant upper stomach pain, persistent fatigue, a weight loss of 10 kg, and yellowing of the skin.

**Clinical Examination:**  
The examination revealed anemia and a tender mass in the right upper quadrant.

**Investigations:**  
A CT scan was performed, revealing a 7 × 5 cm thick-walled, complex mass near the duodenum containing fluid and air, in proximity to the colon. The working diagnosis was a collection caused by a perforation in the colon. The patient was treated with antibiotics and showed improvement with conservative management.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was discharged after a month and underwent a colonoscopy, which identified a lesion in the transverse colon. Histology confirmed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.

**Subsequent Admission:**  
The patient returned to the Accident and Emergency Department with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. A repeat CT scan indicated a localized perforation in the colon with an abscess near the duodenum and thickening in the ascending colon around the hepatic flexure.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
Due to diagnostic uncertainty, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, revealing a large perforated tumor at the hepatic flexure with ascites and peritoneal tumor nodules. A laparotomy through a transverse incision showed the tumor had invaded the gallbladder and duodenum, with an abscess cavity in front of the second part of the duodenum. The size of the perforation was 5 cm × 2 cm, and significant malignant invasion of the duodenum was noted, making primary closure impossible.

**Procedure:**  
A right hemicolectomy was performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and an ileotransverse anastomosis was formed. The anterior wall could not be repaired due to the extent of the disease and the associated abscess.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to return for any future concerns or symptoms. Further follow-up and management will be based on the patient's recovery and any additional symptoms that may arise.
