**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:15:26 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Urinary problems, dysuria, and intermittent hematuria for the past 2 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing urinary problems, including dysuria and intermittent hematuria, for the past 2 years. These symptoms began after the removal of her second IUD, which was inserted 40 days postpartum following her third pregnancy. The patient had no complaints for six years after the insertion of the second IUD.

**Past Medical History:**  
- IUD inserted 9 years ago, followed by an unexpected pregnancy three months later. The pregnancy was the patient's third and was carried to term without complications, resulting in a normal vaginal delivery.
- Second IUD inserted 40 days postpartum, with no complaints for six years.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Initial physical examination showed no remarkable findings.

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
- **Urinalysis:** Showed pyuria and hematuria; urine culture was negative.
- **Abdominal Ultrasonography:** Revealed an echogenic intravesical lesion measuring about 27 mm with a distal acoustic shadow, suggestive of a foreign body or calculus.
- **Plain Radiography of the Pelvis:** Not informative enough to show details of a foreign body.
- **Transvaginal Ultrasonography:** Indicated that more than half of the echogenic foreign body seemed to be in the bladder and a small part in the uterovesical space.

**Consultations:**  
- **Obstetrics and Gynecology:** Gynecologic examination reported no visible strings of the IUD and a closed cervix.

**Procedures:**  
- **Cystoscopic Evaluation:** Performed under local anesthesia, revealing a partially embedded intravesical IUD on the posterior bladder wall, complicated with stone formation.
- **Endoscopic Surgery:** Patient underwent endoscopic surgery to remove the stone around the IUD.

**Plan:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor progress and ensure resolution of symptoms.
