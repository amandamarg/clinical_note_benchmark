**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:31:45 PM  

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Chief Complaint:** Nonhealing ulcerated tissue on the left lower back tooth region for the past 6 months.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and a burning sensation when consuming spicy or hot food items. Over the past week, the patient has experienced a continuous severe burning sensation accompanied by pain in the same area. There is no relevant past medical, dental, occupational, or habit history related to the chief complaint.  

**Examination:**  
- **Soft Tissue Examination:** A solitary, firm, ulcerative tissue measuring 2 × 2 centimeters was found on the alveolar mucosa near the premolar region, separated from the clinically healthy mucosa.  
- Upon stretching the cheek mucosa, a tooth root was found extruding from the socket, impinging on the surrounding soft tissue. No other lesions were found on either side of the oral mucosa.  

**Interim Diagnosis:** Traumatic ulcer in association with the tooth as the source of origin.  

**Treatment:**  
- Extraction of the tooth root under local anaesthesia was performed. The procedure was uneventful.  
- Postoperative instructions were provided.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- The patient reported being normal and free of complaints during the postoperative follow-up made after 15 days.  
- However, the patient returned to the Outpatient Department with similar complaints of pain and severe burning sensation after 3 months in the same region.  

**Subsequent Examination:**  
- On intraoral examination, a nodular proliferous ulcerative growth measuring 3 × 2 centimeters was found on the alveolar mucosa near the premolar-molar region with focal areas of white spots.  

**Plan:**  
- The patient was referred immediately to the oral pathology department.  
- Prescribed topical application of antiviral drugs (2% acyclovir) for a week.  
- As the lesion did not show signs of regression, routine blood investigations were carried out to rule out any complications.  
- An incisional biopsy was advised.  

**Patient Education:** The patient was informed about the findings and the treatment plan.
