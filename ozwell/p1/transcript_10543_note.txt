**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Johnson  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe pain in the left hip and thigh following a basketball injury.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient, a [age]-year-old [gender], presented with severe pain in the left hip and thigh after jumping for a rebound during a basketball game last night. The patient was unable to bear weight following the injury and was evaluated in the emergency department, where radiographs revealed a fracture in the left hip. The patient was subsequently transferred to our facility for definitive management.

**Past Medical History:**  
- 5-6 month history of increasing left thigh pain prior to the current injury, which the patient attributed to overuse and did not seek medical care for.
- Motor vehicle accident 9 years ago resulting in a subtrochanteric femur fracture, treated surgically with a dynamic hip screw (DHS). The surgery was performed flawlessly with no complications noted, but details of the postoperative course are limited. Despite discussions with the index surgeon about hardware removal, it was never scheduled, and the hardware was retained into skeletal maturity.

**Imaging Findings:**  
- Transverse periprosthetic femur fracture at the distal aspect of the previously placed DHS.
- Evidence of a potential stress riser at the distal DHS/bone junction with significant bony overgrowth of the DHS.
- Evidence of stress shielding with significant cortical thickening involving the entire lateral cortex.

**Plan:**  
The patient will be taken to the operating room for explant and fracture reduction.

**Assessment:**  
The patient presents with a transverse periprosthetic femur fracture at the distal aspect of a previously placed DHS, likely exacerbated by a stress riser and stress shielding. Surgical intervention is necessary for explant and fracture reduction.
