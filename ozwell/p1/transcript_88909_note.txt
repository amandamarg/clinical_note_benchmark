**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:35:54 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and anorexia.  
- **Pain Severity:** 8/10  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with upper abdominal pain for the past day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days, as well as dizziness and anorexia. The symptoms began 2 days ago.  

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
An emergency contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed an inhomogeneous and enlarged spleen measuring approximately 20 Ã— 11 cm, with fluid in the inferior aspect of the mesenteric fat and free fluid in the abdomen. Enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes were also noted.  

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital, volume resuscitated, and Hct was monitored. There was no history of trauma, and the CT findings did not suggest a traumatic splenic laceration. The oncology service was consulted and suspected lymphoma, recommending against treatment without a tissue diagnosis due to ongoing bleeding.  

**Surgical Intervention:**  
The patient underwent a splenectomy. Intraoperatively, the spleen was found to be massively enlarged with tumor-like areas extruding through the splenic capsule. There was significant ecchymotic tissue inferior to the spleen, with slight oozing controlled as much as possible due to the friable nature of the area. The tail of the pancreas was identified and left intact as there was no bleeding. Estimated blood loss was approximately 2 L.  

**Postoperative Course:**  
Post-extubation, the patient experienced agitation attributed to ETOH withdrawal, with a history of 6 pack per day ETOH abuse. The patient's mental status remained agitated and confused for 4 days despite administration of serax, ativan, and haldol. A psychiatry consult suggested the agitation was secondary to post-op delirium versus a paradoxical ativan reaction. It was considered that the agitation and delirium could be due to pain or sepsis.  

**Antibiotic Therapy:**  
The patient was started on cefazolin 1 gm every 8 hours post-op, later changed to meropenem 1 gm.  

**Plan:**  
Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress.
