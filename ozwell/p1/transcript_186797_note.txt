**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:19:18 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** The patient has a history of diabetes and was previously admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis. The patient also has a history of sigmoid resection for diverticulitis and ERCP for choledocholithiasis without any mention of biliary abnormality.

**Presenting Complaints:**  
- Cough  
- Diffuse abdominal pain  

**Investigations and Findings:**  
- Blood sample investigation revealed mild leucocytosis with PRC augmentation and normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels.  
- Preoperative ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall suggestive of acute cholecystitis.  
- During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, an incidental intraoperative finding of a left-sided gallbladder was noted.  
- Retrospective analysis of a previous CT scan, even with the knowledge of a left-sided gallbladder, was unable to demonstrate its attachment to the left side of the liver, likely due to a hypertrophic left lobe mimicking contiguity with the gallbladder.  
- Vascular and biliary reconstruction showed evidence of agenesis of the right anterior sector of the liver with the absence of the right hepatic duct and an intrahepatic variation with insertion of the right inferior sectorial duct into the left common duct as type A3 of Huang Classification.

**Surgical Procedure:**  
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The anatomical variation was noted, and careful dissection of Calotâ€™s triangle was done. The cystic duct and artery were identified and isolated, demonstrating a right-sided positioning of the cystic duct. Safe clipping and transection of the cystic duct and artery were achieved, and the gallbladder was extracted in an endobag.

**Postoperative Course:**  
- The postoperative course was complicated by an aggravation of diabetes and basal pneumonia, which were controlled postoperatively in the intensive care unit.  
- The patient was discharged on postoperative day 16 in good condition.  

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's recovery and manage diabetes and any respiratory symptoms as needed.  
- Follow-up appointments to ensure continued recovery and address any further complications.
