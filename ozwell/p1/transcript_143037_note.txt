**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Left-sided facial pain for the past three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing sharp, lancinating, and throbbing pain on the left side of the face, radiating to the left temple and cheek. The pain is exacerbated by chewing solid foods. The patient rates the severity of the pain as 8 out of 10. The patient has experienced weight loss due to difficulty eating solid foods. Previous imaging, including a brain MRI and maxillofacial CT, did not reveal any abnormalities. A PET scan performed at another hospital showed a hypermetabolic mass in the esophagus. The patient was previously diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and was taking methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine without relief.

**Physical Examination:**  
The patient appeared in distress due to facial pain. A trigger point was identified over the left masseter muscle, and the temporomandibular joint range of motion was normal. Sensory examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left chin, lower lip, and oral mucosa.

**Imaging:**  
A localized mandibular CT scan was performed, revealing a metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone affecting the inferior alveolar nerve. Review of prior maxillofacial CT and PET scans confirmed the diagnosis.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with spread to the mandibular bone, affecting the inferior alveolar nerve.

**Plan:**  
Due to the advanced stage of the disease, treatment options are limited. The focus will be on managing the patient's pain and ensuring comfort.

**Outcome:**  
The patient eventually passed away. Efforts were made to manage pain and provide comfort.

**Family Communication:**  
The patient's family was informed of the patient's passing and expressed appreciation for the care provided. They were encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns.
