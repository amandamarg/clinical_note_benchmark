**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:10:20 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Occupation:** Laborer  
- **Diagnosis:** Carcinoma lung with metastasis  

**Chief Complaint:**  
- Dyspnea (trouble breathing)

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with complaints of dyspnea. The patient has a known diagnosis of carcinoma lung with metastasis and has experienced breathing difficulties for some time. The patient has had five previous episodes of pleural aspiration followed by thoracocentesis. The option of thoracoscopy and talc poudrage was offered but refused by the patient.

**Plan and Procedure:**  
To address the patient's condition, we planned to insert an indwelling intercostal tube. To avoid hampering motility, we employed a newer economical technique using an indwelling pleural catheter. After obtaining detailed informed consent, the site for ICD insertion was marked with ultrasonography in the mid axillary line. The skin was thoroughly cleaned with betadine and methylated spirit. Lignocaine 2% was administered at the point of ICD insertion and subcutaneously in the line between two points. An 18 Fr rhemsons ICD tube was inserted and passed through the subcutaneous tunnel. The rear end of the tube was used as an airtight cap after reversing it. One stitch was placed at the ICD site and another at the second point.

**Outcome:**  
The patient can now move around without carrying the ICD bag, with the ICD in situ continuously, and is comfortable with the tube.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was advised to return if any problems arise.
