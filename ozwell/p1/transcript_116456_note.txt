**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:01:17 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain and growth in the mouth for the past 5 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a dull gnawing pain and a growth on the left side of the upper gums, which has been progressively enlarging over the past 5 years. The growth has caused difficulty in eating and swallowing. The patient noted a sudden increase in the size of the growth 20 days prior to the visit, coinciding with the removal of a tooth fragment from the growth.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Road traffic accident 5 years ago with injuries to the front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face. The growth on the left upper gums was first noticed a few months post-injury.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Gross asymmetry of the face due to a diffuse swelling involving the lower two-thirds of the left side of the face. The swelling extends from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and from the midline to the left preauricular region.
- The mass is reddish pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface, measuring approximately 10 cm × 6 cm, protruding from the oral cavity, preventing mouth closure.
- The growth is not fixed to the buccal mucosa or vestibular sulcus but is attached to the left maxillary alveolus and palate.
- No surface ulceration observed, but random bleeding spots are present.
- Upper posterior teeth are displaced and attached to the mass on the palatal side.
- The growth is firm, tender, with an irregular surface, and fixed to the upper left alveolus.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**  
- Computed tomography angiogram showed no irregular feeder vessels. Imaging revealed a soft-tissue shadow with calcifications, measuring approximately 10 cm × 6 cm, causing destruction of the maxilla in the premolar region but not involving the mandible.

**Laboratory Tests:**  
- Routine blood investigations and serology tests were conducted.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient has an abnormally extensive lesion. The treatment plan involves the implementation of Weber F, which includes a series of procedures and follow-up appointments to monitor progress. The patient has been advised to return for follow-up appointments and to communicate any questions or concerns.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will need to attend follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring and management of the condition.
