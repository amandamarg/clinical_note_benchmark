**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Location:** Central America
- **Past Medical History:** Adult onset type 2 diabetes (on metformin), right inguinal hernia repair, non-smoker, not overweight.

**Bladder Cancer History:**
- **April 2016:** Presented with gross hematuria. Diagnosed with two papillary tumors, Ta, low grade. Underwent transurethral resection.
- **Post-April 2016:** Surveillance cystoscopy was negative.
- **October 2016:** Four LG Ta tumors resected. Underwent 6 weeks of intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C.
- **August 2018:** Multifocal bladder cancer found. Transurethral resection revealed high grade Ta urothelial cancer with focal carcinoma in situ. Received one dose of intravesical MMC postoperatively. Consulted in South Florida.

**Current Symptoms:**
- Nocturia×4
- Daytime frequency
- Prior to recent TUR BT: Nocturia×2, no daytime voiding complaints.

**Recent Evaluation:**
- September 2018: Reviewed recent bladder tissue and performed office flexible cystoscopy. Observed several areas of necrosis consistent with MMC effect on previously resected urothelium. Detected areas of persistent or new tumor, appearing as high grade Ta.

**Discussion and Recommendation:**
- Two alternatives considered: 
  1. Proceed with TUR BT to remove all visible tumor. If pathology confirms high grade Ta with or without CIS, consider bladder preservation approach.
  2. Bladder preservation approach with a course of intravesical BCG, as the patient has not had bladder cancer invading the lamina propria or muscularis propria.
- Recommendation: Bladder preservation approach with intravesical BCG. Further discussion with the patient is necessary to make a final decision together.
