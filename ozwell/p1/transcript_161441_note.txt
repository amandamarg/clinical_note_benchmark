**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Elbow injury following a fall.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with an elbow injury sustained from a fall on an outstretched hand. Initial symptoms included swelling and a hard bony lump on the inside of the elbow. The patient reported weakness in the fourth and fifth fingers and decreased sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution.

**Examination and Findings:**  
- Radiograph revealed a fracture in the radial neck and dislocation of the radial head.
- Surgical intervention was performed with an open reduction through a short curvilinear incision on the inside of the elbow. A mini fragment T plate was used to fix the radial head in place, and elbow stability was confirmed.
- Post-surgery, the patient was found to have an ulnar nerve injury. Indomethacin was prescribed for pain management.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient was lost to follow-up for a few months and returned for a review. The patient reports a range of motion from 30° to 130° and is satisfied with the elbow function. However, the ulnar nerve has not recovered.

**Recent Investigations:**  
- X-ray indicated a suspicious developing proximal radioulnar synostosis and union of the fracture site. Implants were removed.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the potential issue with the bones in the arm.
- Encourage active mobilization exercises to maintain arm strength.
- Advise the patient to protect the arm and return for further evaluation if needed.

**Patient Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient did not have any additional questions at this time.
