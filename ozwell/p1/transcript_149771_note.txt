**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:09:13 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Referred for:** Orthopedic treatment  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing constant pain in the left hip joint and lower back, which worsens with movement and affects daily activities. The patient has a history of achondroplasia and has undergone several orthopedic operations. Additionally, the patient has psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. The patient previously underwent bilateral total hip arthroplasty, resulting in the left leg becoming longer than the right leg. The patient attempted using a heel elevation on the right side, but it did not provide significant relief. The patient strongly opposes the option of lengthening the right leg.

**Objective:**  
- Medical history includes achondroplasia, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis.
- Previous bilateral total hip arthroplasty with resultant leg length discrepancy (left leg longer than right).

**Assessment:**  
The patient presents with persistent pain in the left hip joint and lower back, likely related to the leg length discrepancy post-arthroplasty and underlying conditions.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's condition.
- Advise the patient to rest and avoid activities that may exacerbate the pain.
- Discuss further therapeutic options if there are any changes in the patient's condition.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to reach out with any concerns or questions. Further evaluation and discussion of treatment options will be conducted as needed.
