**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain, swelling, and redness on the left leg.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain, swelling, and redness on the left leg for approximately one month. There is no history of specific trauma that could have caused these symptoms. Two weeks after admission, the redness localized to the front of the leg, forming a fluid-filled, red mass. A draining sinus developed on the mass, discharging a thick fluid with a chalk-like material through the shiny skin via the sinus.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Liver cirrhosis
- Tibial plateau fracture 18 years ago, treated with open reduction and internal fixation
- Sciatic nerve injury
- Distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture 8 years post initial trauma, treated with stent insertion in the femoral artery

**Imaging and Tests:**  
- Radiographs and angiography performed at the time of femoral artery rupture revealed a mass on the leg and an obstruction in the popliteal artery.

**Functional Status:**  
The patient reports no difficulty with daily life functions, except for limited motion in the ankle and toes and some sensory reduction in the foot due to the sciatic nerve injury.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Range of motion: Knee flexion 0 to 100 degrees; Ankle dorsiflexion 0 degrees, plantar flexion 5 degrees
- Motor strength: Ankle dorsiflexion grade 0, plantar flexion grade 3
- Sensation: No sensation in the first web space and medial aspect of the foot; sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation
- Toes exhibit a clawing deformity

**Treatment and Management:**  
The patient was maintained with a long leg splint after admission.

**Plan:**  
Further tests are required to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up instructions will be provided based on test results.
