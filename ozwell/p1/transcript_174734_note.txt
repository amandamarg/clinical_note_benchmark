**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Procedure:** Elective Left Total Knee Arthroplasty  

**History:**
The patient has a history of lupus and presented for elective left total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. The patient had a previous left knee ACL reconstruction approximately 25 years ago using the Arthrotek bone mulch screw and WasherLoc system. The tibial WasherLoc was removed about 10 years ago. The patient reported no current issues with the previous ACL reconstruction.

**Surgical Procedure:**
The patient was positioned supine, and a standard incision with a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. A measured resection technique was utilized with an intramedullary guide placed in the femur. The femur was cut in 6 degrees of valgus and 3 degrees of external rotation. A size 4 femoral prosthesis was initially placed but noted to overhang both medially and laterally on the condyles. It was decided to downsize the femoral component. The 4 in 1 femoral cutting block was placed back on the femur and was in contact with the bone mulch ACL screw, which was located and removed from the lateral femoral condyle using a curette.

The proximal tibia was prepared using an intramedullary guide with 3 degrees of posterior slope. A size 3 tibial component and a 9 mm poly were placed; however, the knee was tight in both flexion and extension. An additional 2 mm resection was performed on the proximal tibia. During trialing, a fracture of the lateral femoral condyle was noted. Conversion to a stemmed femoral component with a cruciate stabilizing prosthesis was attempted, but a fracture of the medial femoral condyle was also noted. An intraoperative consultation with an adult reconstruction trained orthopaedic surgeon was performed. Immediate surgical correction was not possible due to improper implants being presented. The femoral and tibial canals were reamed.

**Outcome:**
Despite best efforts, the patient did not survive the surgery.

**Family Discussion:**
The family was informed of the situation and expressed gratitude for the efforts made.

**Notes:**
The patient reported feeling uncomfortable but not in pain during the procedure. Post-procedure, the patient felt good, with only slight soreness. The patient did not recall specific details about the surgery or the intraoperative consultation.
