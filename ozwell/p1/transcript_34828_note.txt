**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **Chief Complaint:** Swelling in the neck

**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient reports a swelling in the neck that has been present for about a year and is increasing in size. The swelling is not painful but has become more noticeable.

**Physical Examination:**
- A single swelling is observed in the anterior part of the neck, measuring 13 by 8 cm, irregular in shape, extending vertically from the thyroid cartilage above to the suprasternal notch below, and between the two sternomastoid muscles. The swelling is firm in consistency and moves freely with deglutition. The lower margin is ill-defined. No cervical lymphadenopathy is noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous systems, and abdomen are normal.

**Investigations:**
- Thyroid function test: Within normal range
- Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid swelling: Revealed papillary carcinoma
- Ultrasound of the neck: Documented a single mass in the anterior neck, 12 by 8 cm in size with complex cystic and solid components. No associated cervical lymphadenopathy.

**Surgical Findings:**
- Total thyroidectomy was performed. The left lobe of the thyroid was slightly enlarged (4 by 3 by 3 cm), while the right lobe was normal sized (3 by 3 by 2 cm). An additional swelling, the thymus, was found measuring 8 by 4 by 3 cm, adjacent to but separate from the thyroid at its lower margin and extending up to the suprasternal notch. The thyroid and the thymus were connected by a fibrous band.

**Post-operative Findings:**
- Histopathological examination of the thyroid specimen confirmed papillary carcinoma. Sections from the attached mass (thymus) revealed multiple cysts with tissue replaced by metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Both tumors were reactive to thyroglobulin, keratin, and CD3, confirming papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with metastasis to ectopic cervical thymus.

**Follow-up:**
- A radioiodine scan on follow-up did not detect any residual or other metastatic disease. The patient is on regular follow-up and is doing well.

**Plan:**
- Continue regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any recurrence or new developments.
