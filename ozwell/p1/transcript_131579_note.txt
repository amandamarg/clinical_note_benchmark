**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Open wound on leg with fracture following a traffic accident.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was involved in a traffic accident resulting in an open wound on the leg measuring approximately 16 by 6 cm, accompanied by a fracture. A free flap procedure was planned, utilizing a flap from the ipsilateral thigh. The pedicle of the flap was intended to be 14 cm from the middle of the flap to the recipient vessel and 9 cm from the flap margin.

During surgery, a perforator was identified branching at the proximal descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, measuring 7 cm in length. The available length of the descending branch on the proximal side was 2 cm. Dissection was performed on the distal aspect to extend the pedicle length, successfully obtaining a reverse ALT free flap with a total pedicle length of 14 cm in the distal direction.

The proximal descending branch was clamped to check for flap circulation, confirming flap congestion due to impaired retrograde flow through the valves of the vena comitans in the distal direction. The congestion was resolved by connecting one of the venae comitantes of the distal descending branch to the proximal venous stump in an antegrade manner. The diameter discrepancy of the venous anastomosis was not significant.

A modified ALT flap pedicle of 15 cm in length was formed to prevent venous congestion and ensure adequate length to reach the recipient vessel. Consequently, the direction of the arterial flow to the flap was retrograde, and the venous flow was antegrade.

**Postoperative Evaluation:**  
The flap condition was evaluated post-surgery by checking the flap color, performing the pin-prick test, and using Doppler ultrasonography. For 2 days following the surgery, the flap status was maintained with no findings of congestion or insufficiency.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the flap condition closely for any signs of congestion or insufficiency. Further follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure proper healing and recovery.
