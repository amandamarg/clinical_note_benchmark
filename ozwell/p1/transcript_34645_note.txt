**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. X  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Chronic urticaria for the past three years with almost daily episodes of hives that are intensely pruritic and last less than a day.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Well-controlled asthma  
- Allergic rhinitis  
- Atopic dermatitis  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has been experiencing chronic urticaria for the past three years. They have almost daily episodes of hives that are intensely pruritic and last less than a day. The patient has previously been treated with various combinations of high-dose first and second-generation antihistamines without success. Montelukast was also tried but did not provide relief when added to antihistamines. The patient found relief with oral prednisone or cyclosporine, but experienced a transient decrease in renal function of unknown significance with cyclosporine and was intolerant of prednisone due to weight gain and psychosis. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of true urticaria and ruled out urticarial vasculitis. Laboratory tests were unrevealing regarding the potential etiology of the hives. Symptoms are not associated with food or medications. The patient has been monitoring their symptoms and is fearful of the toxic effects of cyclosporine.

**Current Treatment:**  
The patient was started on omalizumab and reported significant improvement after the first treatment. Over the next two weeks, they were able to wean off cyclosporine down to 25 mg daily without any urticarial flare. By the eighth treatment visit, the patient was able to completely withdraw from cyclosporine. Initially, the patient experienced a generalized sensation of pruritus without visible lesions, which was controlled with diphenhydramine 25 mg every 8 hours, and later with this.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's progress on omalizumab.  
- Address any concerns or questions the patient may have during follow-up visits.  
- Monitor for any potential side effects or flare-ups.  

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will continue with regular follow-up visits to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment and make any necessary adjustments.
