**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** Susan  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]

**Subjective:**
Susan reports worsening pain and difficulty with daily activities. She has a history of scoliosis and underwent carpal tunnel surgery on her right hand during her time as a hairstylist. Despite various treatments, including chiropractic care, Chinese medicine, yoga, and swimming, her symptoms persist. She notes that certain yoga movements and swimming strokes exacerbate her pain. 

In her early forties, Susan began experiencing weakness in her lower body, with her legs giving out on stairs and a loss of bladder and bowel control. An MRI led to emergency surgery to stabilize her cervical spine and relieve spinal cord compression. Unfortunately, the surgery resulted in paralysis on her right side, requiring an 8-week hospital stay for rehabilitation. A subsequent surgery for pain relief was unsuccessful, and she now receives weekly injections that provide marginal pain relief for about one week. She also experiences heightened sensitivity in her legs, where even a bed sheet can cause pain.

**Objective:**
- History of scoliosis
- Previous carpal tunnel surgery on the right hand
- Post-surgical complications including right-side paralysis
- Heightened sensitivity in legs

**Assessment:**
Susan's symptoms and medical history suggest ongoing issues with pain management and neurological function. The previous surgeries have not provided the desired relief, and her current treatment plan is insufficient.

**Plan:**
- Schedule follow-up tests to explore alternative treatment options.
- Continue weekly pain relief injections.
- Monitor and assess areas of heightened sensitivity.
- Encourage Susan to reach out with any questions or concerns.

**Follow-up:**
Arrange for follow-up testing and consultations to develop a more effective treatment plan.
