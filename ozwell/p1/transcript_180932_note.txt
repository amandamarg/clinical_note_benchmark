**Clinical Note:**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:25:04 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay but expresses nervousness about the test results.

**Objective:**  
- Abdominal ultrasound results indicate a right adrenal lesion measuring 9 cm in diameter.  
- The lesion is described as a soft tissue encapsulated mass of 10 x 9 cm in the right adrenal gland.  
- The patient is asymptomatic, and the physical examination was normal.

**Assessment:**  
- Right adrenal lesion identified.  
- Further evaluation is necessary to determine the nature of the lesion.

**Plan:**  
1. Conduct an endocrinological evaluation to assess the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and check for hyper secretion of catecholamines.  
2. Based on the endocrinological evaluation results, determine if the mass is secreting or non-secreting.  
   - If non-secreting, proceed with an adrenal scan for further information.  
   - If secreting, perform additional tests to identify the specific hormones being secreted and determine the appropriate treatment.  
3. Consider a laparoscopic trans peritoneal adrenalectomy for mass removal.  
   - The procedure involves inserting trocars into the abdomen and removing the mass through a small incision.  
   - Special care will be taken during dissection, with trocars used for retraction and irrigation.  
4. Schedule surgery after completing necessary tests and scans.  
5. Patient is encouraged to bring family members to the next appointment for support.

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule further tests and scans as soon as possible.  
- Keep the patient informed at every step of the process.  

**Patient Education:**  
- Discussed the routine nature of the laparoscopic procedure and reassured the patient about the care taken during surgery.  
- Encouraged the patient to bring family for support during the next appointment.
