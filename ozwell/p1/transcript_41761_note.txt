**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented for an orthopedic examination due to a mass on the right buttock that has been growing rapidly. The mass has been present for over 5 years, initially growing gradually but recently increasing in size more rapidly. The patient had a previous debulking of a tumor from the right buttock at age 18, which was complicated by significant bleeding, a severe drop in blood pressure, and acute kidney failure, requiring 8 units of blood for stabilization. The patient did not continue follow-up after discharge. The mass has continued to grow and is now limiting daily activities.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed a large, firm, amorphous, fluctuant, soft tissue mass measuring 60 × 50 × 30 cm, extending from the lumbar region to the gluteal fold and overhanging from the posterior aspect of the thigh. An MRI was performed but was limited due to the size of the tumor, with some parts outside the field of view. The MRI showed intermediate signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images, fluid collections, and serpiginous flow voids indicating prominent vasculature. The mass did not infiltrate the underlying gluteal musculature. A core needle biopsy was performed, and results were consistent with PNF, with no evidence of malignancy.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The case was reviewed by our multidisciplinary musculoskeletal tumor committee. The plan is to perform a preoperative embolization to potentially reduce perioperative blood loss, considering the vascularity and size of the lesion. This will be followed by surgical resection of the bulk of the lesion. Closure will be achieved with local tissue advancement or free flap transfer. The patient understands the plan and has no further questions at this time.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient is advised to return with any questions or concerns. Further follow-up will be scheduled as needed.
