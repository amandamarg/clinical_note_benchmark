**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:57:29 PM  

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Recurrent palpitations for the last 10 years.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing recurrent palpitations over the past 10 years, with an increase in frequency leading to 5 hospitalizations in the last year. During these hospitalizations, the palpitations were terminated using intravenous adenosine and verapamil. The patient denies any history of diabetes or hypertension.

**Physical Examination:**  
General physical and cardiovascular examinations were normal.

**Investigations:**  
- Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed left bundle branch block with a normal PR interval.
- ECG during tachycardia revealed similar morphology with a heart rate of 210 beats/min.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of structural heart disease.

**Electrophysiological Study:**  
A presumptive diagnosis of AVNRT was made, and an electrophysiological study was planned. During catheter manipulation, the patient developed a complete heart block due to trauma to the right bundle, necessitating temporary right ventricular pacing. No tachycardia was induced during the complete heart block, and there was no evidence of an accessory pathway. The complete heart block persisted for 3 hours. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 48 hours.

**Follow-up:**  
The patient experienced 3 episodes of tachycardia within 15 days post-discharge, all terminated with intravenous adenosine.

**Restudy:**  
A restudy was planned with the aim of avoiding His bundle/Right bundle injury. During the restudy, a catheter was inserted into the right internal jugular vein, and an angiogram revealed an absent right superior vena cava with the entire jugular system draining into a hugely dilated coronary sinus, which was not detected on the initial TTE.

**Discussion:**  
The risk of ablation was discussed with the patient and family, including the potential development of complete heart block.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring and consider further management options while minimizing risks associated with ablation.
