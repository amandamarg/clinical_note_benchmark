**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Headache and fever for a few days.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a headache and fever persisting for several days. Prior to hospital admission, the patient exhibited personality changes, violent behavior, and difficulty speaking, leading to admission to the neurology department.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Brain imaging revealed minimal changes, including mild brain edema.
- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed lymphocyte pleocytosis, indicating inflammatory changes.

**Initial Treatment and Diagnosis:**  
Based on initial findings, the presumptive diagnosis was either viral encephalitis or autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with intravenous high-dose steroids, acyclovir, and glycerol.

**Progression and Further Symptoms:**  
A few days post-admission, the patient developed involuntary movements, disturbance of consciousness, and central hypoventilation. Assisted respiration was provided, and the patient was medicated with midazolam and propofol.

**Further Examination and Diagnosis:**  
Subsequent examinations suggested autoimmune encephalitis as the most likely diagnosis. Plasma exchange treatment was initiated. The patient was examined for a potential ovarian teratoma.

**Imaging and Surgical Findings:**  
- Internal examination and transvaginal ultrasonography did not detect an ovarian teratoma.
- T1-weighted pelvic MRI revealed a 5 × 7 mm fat intensity in the right ovary, suggesting a teratoma.
- T2-weighted pelvic MRI showed numerous similar-sized ovarian follicles surrounding the teratoma.
- Initial abdominal CT with 10 mm slice thickness did not detect any fatty component in the right ovary. However, CT with 1 mm slice thickness, referencing MRI findings, detected the fatty component with a mean CT number of −62.5 HU.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
Eighteen days post-admission, the patient underwent a laparoscopic operation for complete resection of the right ovarian teratoma. The macroscopic appearance of the right ovary showed no abnormalities. A partial resection of the right ovary was performed, removing small pieces from the most likely location of the teratoma. The first resected 22 × 22 mm ovarian piece contained an intact 5 × 7 mm cystic tumor.

**Current Status:**  
The patient reports feeling better.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and provide ongoing care. The patient is advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be monitored for any changes in condition and will receive continued care as needed.
