**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:34:47 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Gender:** Female  
- **Referred for:** Further evaluation following abnormal fetal echocardiography findings  

**History and Examination:**  
- **Fetal Echocardiography Findings:** Abnormal findings with ended vessels originating from the heart or transposition of the great arteries.  
- **Fetal Ultrasonography:** No other abnormal findings reported.  
- **Medical and Obstetric Histories:** Unremarkable.  

**Initial Ultrasound Examination (First Visit):**  
- **Findings:** Elevated diaphragm with suspicion of associated lung abnormalities.  
- **Thoracic Cavities:** Right thoracic cavity reduced in size; left thoracic cavity largely occupied by the heart with a severely left-deviated axis.  
- **Lung Tissue and Pulmonary Veins:** Not evident.  

**Fetal MRI Study:**  
- **Findings:** Significantly decreased thoracic volume with bilateral elevation of the diaphragm, resulting in upward migration of the heart and rotation of the cardiac axis.  
- **Lung Identification:** No definite lung identified; trachea ended blindly near the level of the cricoid cartilage without bronchial branching.  

**Delivery Details:**  
- **Fetus:** Male, weighing 2,530 g.  
- **Delivery Method:** Induction of labor in the presence of neonatologists.  
- **Apgar Scores:** 2 at 1 minute, 2 at 5 minutes, and 2 at 10 minutes.  

**Post-Delivery:**  
- **Resuscitation Attempts:** Cardiac asystole persisted despite all efforts.  
- **Outcome:** Neonate died at 44 minutes post-delivery.  

**Summary:**  
The patient presented with abnormal fetal echocardiography findings, leading to further evaluation. Initial ultrasound and MRI studies indicated significant thoracic and lung abnormalities. Despite resuscitation efforts, the neonate did not survive post-delivery.
