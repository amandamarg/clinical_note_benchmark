**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient presented with masses on the left arm and axilla, first noticed a number of years prior. The patient has a 20-year history of smoking but no significant medical problems before the initiation of these symptoms. There is no relevant family history of medical conditions or cancer.

- **Previous Medical Evaluation and Treatment:** The patient was referred to a surgical clinic three years ago and had a biopsy of the tumor, which was reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma. At that time, the patient was evaluated only for possible intestinal primaries and received radiotherapy of unclear dosage. Following the recurrence of the tumor, the patient was referred to the medical oncology department with a mass in the left thoracic region and another in the left humerus, visible on X-rays. Examination revealed an additional mass in the left breast.

- **Pathology and Diagnosis:** Reevaluation of biopsy materials in our pathology department confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma, with the report indicating the mass might be breast-originated, raising suspicion towards a possible breast primary.

- **Treatment:** The patient was given neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and capecitabine for six cycles following the decision of our tumor council.

- **Imaging and Current Findings:** An MRI scan obtained following the cessation of chemotherapy revealed a 140 × 100 × 90 mm lobulated mass in the proximal epiphyses, metaphysis, and diaphysis of the left humerus, destructing the cortices on multiple sides with a large soft tissue component, and invading and protruding out of the skin. Another mass, 123 × 54 × 74 mm in size, was located in the axillary region adjacent to the thoracic wall, infiltrating the skin, and surrounded by multiple nodular masses of different sizes. Other masses were also noted.

**Plan:** Further evaluation and management will be discussed in the upcoming tumor board meeting to determine the next steps in the patient's treatment plan.
