**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:21:24 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- Gravida 2, Para 1-0-0-1  

**Reason for Referral:**  
- Referred for fetal echocardiography due to abnormally looking great arterial arches.

**Pregnancy History:**  
- No complications reported during the current pregnancy.  
- No history of diseases or use of drugs or herbal medications during pregnancy.  
- No family history of congenital heart disease.

**Obstetric Evaluation:**  
- Normal fetal growth.  
- Normal amount of amniotic fluid.  
- Normal placenta.

**Fetal Echocardiography Findings:**  
- Normal four-chamber view with two atria and two ventricles of normal size and thickness.  
- Normal movement of the two atrioventricular valves.  
- Two great arteries arose normally from the appropriate ventricles.  
- Normal appearance of the pulmonary and aortic valves.  
- Main pulmonary artery and aortic root size within normal limits.  
- Normal size and location of the aortic arch.  
- Ductal arch not visualized in any views.  
- Main pulmonary artery bifurcated into two branch pulmonary arteries but was not continuous with the ductal arch (DA).  
- Color Doppler examination showed a tortuous 'S' shaped ductus cuddled inside the aortic arch.  
- DA joined the descending aorta with an obtuse angle and showed a flow signal from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta.  
- Color aliasing occurred along the course of the ductus.  
- Pulsed Doppler measurement of velocity was not attempted due to poor angle of insonation.  
- Flow velocity and waveforms of the two great arteries were within normal limits.  
- No tricuspid regurgitation (TR) found.

**Diagnosis:**  
- S-shaped ductal arch (DA) with mild narrowing.

**Follow-up:**  
- A repeat examination at 27 weeks of gestation showed nearly the same findings.  
- Right ventricle (RV) was normal in size and thickness.  
- No TR noted.  
- Due to the S-shaped DA, it was difficult to assess size along the whole range of the DA.  
- Color Doppler examination showed tortuous turbulent flow in the ductus, suggesting mild obstruction.

**Plan:**  
- Continue monitoring the pregnancy with follow-up examinations.

**Physician's Notes:**  
- Patient advised to reach out with any questions or concerns.
