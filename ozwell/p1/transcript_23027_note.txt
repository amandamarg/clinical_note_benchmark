**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Blurriness and visual indistinctness.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted with complaints of blurriness and visual indistinctness, which have been present for a year and have worsened over the past 2 weeks.

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient has a history of tuberculosis and is on regular anti-TB medication.

**Neurologic Examination:**  
Revealed oculomotor paralysis.

**Imaging and Diagnostic Tests:**  
- **MRI Findings:** Significant dilation of the intracranial segment in the left internal carotid artery. Slight dilation of the left anterior cerebral artery and the starting point of the MCA. A circular liquid signal shadow under the inner wall of the left maxillary sinus, approximately 16 mm in diameter.
- **Cerebral Angiography:** The left internal carotid artery GSA measured 48.61 mm Ã— 23.40 mm, with proximal vessel diameter of 4.65 mm and distal vessel diameter of 3.16 mm.

**Surgical Considerations:**  
The family was informed of the conditions and signed a consent form prior to the operation. The balloon occlusion test indicated an open anterior communicating artery and good compensatory blood supply from the contralateral internal carotid artery. However, there is potential for further growth of the ipsilateral MCA, which could lead to facial nerve compression due to higher blood flow to the external carotid artery.

**Treatment Plan:**  
The family rejected the traumatic treatment method of direct trapping of the parent artery. Instead, stent insertion was chosen to reconstruct the original structure of the vessel. Antiplatelet therapy (100 mg aspirin + 75 mg clopidogrel daily) was administered at least 3 days prior to the operation. The patient underwent surgery after being diagnosed with anesthesia.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient was informed about the conditions and treatment received. No further questions were raised by the patient at this time. The patient was advised to reach out with any concerns or additional questions.

**Plan:**  
Continue monitoring the patient's condition and ensure follow-up appointments are scheduled to assess recovery and any potential complications.
