**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Location:** [Clinic/Hospital Name]  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Intractable pain in the right upper extremity.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a history of constant and unbearable pain, which began approximately 10 months ago. Initially, the patient visited the emergency department with pain and swelling in the right arm. A computed tomography scan of the neck with contrast revealed masses in the right axillary and right supraclavicular regions. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis. Despite undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the patient experienced thrombocytopenia and metastatic disease progression. The patient was determined to be a nonsurgical candidate. 

The patient's pain has been worsening, particularly in the right upper extremity, and is described as dull, aching, burning, and electric in nature. The pain is exacerbated by both passive and active range of motion. The patient also reports worsening weakness in the entire right upper extremity. 

**Current Medications:**  
- Extended release morphine  
- Immediate release morphine  
- Methadone  
- Gabapentin  

**Diagnostic Studies:**  
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus. A diagnostic brachial plexus block was performed due to functional decline and acute worsening of pain. However, the brachial plexus was unable to be visualized using ultrasonography in the classic supraclavicular area due to the tumor effect.

**Assessment and Plan:**  
The patient was referred to our pain clinic for further management of intractable pain. Despite being started on opioid therapy, pain control remains suboptimal. We discussed further management options, including titration of oral medications and interventional pain management techniques such as nerve blocks or spinal cord stimulation. The patient was advised to return for a follow-up appointment to continue working on the best management plan for her pain.

**Outcome:**  
Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the patient eventually passed away due to complications of metastatic disease progression. Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time. 

**Family Discussion:**  
The patient's family was informed of the situation and the efforts made to manage the patient's pain and provide comfort in her final days.
