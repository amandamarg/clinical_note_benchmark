**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Name Redacted]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient has Alzheimer's disease.

**Medical History:**  
The patient has a history of Alzheimer's disease. The medical record indicates that the patient has passed away, with the cause of death reported as Alzheimer's disease.

**Findings from Dissection:**  
- An enlarged gallbladder filled with fluid was identified. There was no evidence of past inflammation, such as adhesions or other structural changes in the gallbladder wall.  
- The enlargement is hypothesized to be due to a congenital septal abnormality, potentially causing symptoms of biliary colic during life. The septum may have intermittently obstructed the cystic duct during gallbladder contraction, resulting in incomplete emptying and subsequent enlargement.  
- An aberrant right hepatic artery and an accessory left hepatic artery were found. The right hepatic artery was not in its normal location, and there was an additional left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric artery.  
- The biliary duct system appeared enlarged: the cystic duct measured 12 mm (normal size 2-3 mm), the hepatic duct measured 18 mm (normal size 6 mm), and the common bile duct measured 21 mm (normal size 7 mm).  
- It is conjectured that the patient may have passed a gallstone prior to death, causing constriction at the pancreaticobiliary antrum and subsequent dilation of the biliary tree. However, no stones, mucus, or obstructive masses were found in the gallbladder or along its drainage path into the duodenum. The common bile duct, near its termination, measured 7 mm with a patent opening into the pancreaticobiliary antrum.  
- There was no anatomical explanation for the enlarged ductal system.

**Plan:**  
The patient has passed away. The findings from the dissection will be communicated to the patient's family.
