**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling okay today. They have a history of radiation treatment for squamous carcinoma located in the left lower jaw. The patient is here for a composite resection and reconstruction procedure.

**Objective:**  
The procedure involves the removal of cancer and reconstruction of the jaw using a fibula free flap. The left fibula has been selected for the flap harvest. During the procedure, it was noted that the blood flow in the superior thyroid artery was inadequate after dissecting and dividing it. Attempts to improve the flow with warm saline, xylocaine solution, and papaverine were unsuccessful.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
Three options were considered to address the inadequate blood flow:  
1. Open the right neck and use the vessels from that side.  
2. Use a vein graft and anastomose with the facial artery on the left side.  
3. Use the distal end of the flap pedicle vessels for anastomosis with the left facial artery.  

The decision was made to attempt retrograde vascularization of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. The arterial anastomosis was completed between the distal end of the peroneal artery and the left facial artery, and the arterial flow was checked. The procedure was successful, and the arterial flow is now good.

The patient will be monitored closely for the next few days to ensure proper healing. The patient has been advised to ask any questions or express any concerns they may have.

**Follow-up:**  
Continue to monitor the patient closely for signs of proper healing and address any concerns as they arise.
