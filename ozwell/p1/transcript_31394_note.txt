**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** John  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Reason for Visit:** Evaluation of a lung lesion referred to pediatric surgery.

**Medical History:**  
- Born at 37 weeks via cesarean section for breech presentation.  
- Birthweight: 2.78 kg.  
- Developed respiratory distress after birth, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.  
- Chest X-ray demonstrated multiple cystic lucencies in the right lung field.  
- Prenatal care was limited; unknown if the lesion was diagnosed on ultrasound.  
- Required CPAP for respiratory support, weaned off on day 1 of life.  
- Discharged home on day 7 of life to follow up with pediatric surgery.  
- No further respiratory symptoms reported by parents.

**Recent Evaluation:**  
- Computed tomography angiogram revealed a cystic lung lesion in the right lower lobe with a large systemic artery originating from the distal thoracic aorta proximal to the origin of the celiac artery.  
- Diagnosis: Pulmonary Sequestration (PS).

**Treatment Plan:**  
- Due to the large size of the systemic feeding vessel, angiographic embolization was performed preoperatively to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding.  
- Ideal resection age was 3 months, delayed until 7 months due to social circumstances.  
- Embolization was done via right femoral arterial access with interventional radiology.  
- Onyx 18 was used for embolization to avoid interference with LigaSure device or endothoracic stapler during surgery.

**Current Status:**  
- Patient remains asymptomatic.  
- Follow-up appointment to be scheduled in a few weeks for continued monitoring.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Continue monitoring the patient's condition and ensure follow-up care.
