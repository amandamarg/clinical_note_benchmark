**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:33:52 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Painless mass on the right wrist.  

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was referred with a painless mass on the right wrist, first noticed a year ago. The local doctor initially diagnosed it as a ganglion. The patient reports no additional symptoms or changes in the body.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- Osteoarthritis  
- Polymyalgia rheumatica  
- Malunion of right distal radius from a fracture sustained 5 months ago; patient declined surgical intervention.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- Right wrist: Radially deviated with a dinner fork deformity.  
- Mass: 6 by 9 cm round mass on the dorsum of the distal radius, painless, adherent to underlying structures and skin. The skin over the mass does not transilluminate.  
- General physical examination: Unremarkable. No obvious lymphadenopathy, breast masses, organomegaly, or lung issues.  
- Right hand: Capillary refill under 2 seconds, palpable radial and ulnar pulses, normal sensory and motor exams.  

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
- Mantoux test: Negative, tuberculosis unlikely.  
- Blood count, renal and liver function: Within normal range.  
- ESR: Elevated at 74.  
- Haemoglobin: 11 g/dl.  
- Ultrasound: Large vascularized soft tissue mass infiltrating tendinous structures on the dorsum.  
- MRI: Large mass causing extensive osteolysis of the distal radius, extending proximally with abnormal marrow replacement in the distal one-third of the radius. Soft tissue component involves entire extensor tendon groups and infiltrates through subcutaneous tissues to the dermis.  
- CT thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, and whole body bone scan: Confirmed isolated lesion with no evidence of dissemination.  

**Plan:**  
- Proceed with a biopsy in theatre following consultation from the National Musculoskeletal Tumour Centre.  
- Monitor the patient's condition closely and schedule follow-up appointments to check on progress.  

**Discussion:**  
The findings suggest a serious condition, but the lesion is isolated with no evidence of dissemination. The patient has been informed and understands the need for further investigation and monitoring.  

**Follow-up:**  
- Schedule biopsy and follow-up appointments.  
- Patient advised to report any new symptoms or concerns.
