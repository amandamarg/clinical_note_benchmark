**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Name]  
**Age:** 37 years  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain in the left arm for the past three months and weakness for the past month.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports a dull, boring pain around the left shoulder that has spread to the left arm and even the thumb and index finger. The pain has been present for the past three months and responds a little to analgesics. The patient also reports sudden onset of weakness in the left arm, initially unable to raise it above the shoulder, which then spread to the entire left limb, resulting in an inability to flex the elbow or grip objects. The weakness has been present for the past month. The patient has also experienced decreased perception of hot and cold, and the texture of clothes. The left shoulder appears thinner than the right, with occasional fasciculations in that region. No weakness or sensory loss in the lower limbs or bladder bowel complaints. No recent history of fever, cough with expectoration or hemoptysis, trauma, weight loss, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension. No complaints of arthralgia, arthritis, rash, or oral ulcers. No recent vaccinations or unsafe sexual practices.

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic left upper trunk brachial plexopathy by a neurologist. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography were performed. The patient was started on oral steroids, which resulted in some pain relief, but the weakness did not respond to treatment. After a month's therapy, the patient began experiencing similar complaints in the right arm and was referred to our center for further evaluation and management.

**Current Condition:**  
Upon arrival at our clinic, the patient developed painful weakness in both upper limbs, with the left being worse than the right, and paraesthesia in both arms. The patient was conscious, oriented, and had normal higher mental functions. Examination revealed wasting around the left shoulder girdle and left arm.

**Plan:**  
Recommend follow-up tests and treatments for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition.
