**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  
**Department:** Orthopedics  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain in the left knee wound, with hardware exposure. The patient denies any other medical issues or comorbidities. The patient has a history of total left hip arthroplasty due to severe osteoarthritis pain, which was performed eight years ago. The patient experienced progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly when walking, leading to difficulties in deambulation. No other symptoms were reported.

**Objective:**  
- X-ray examination revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component.  
- MRI showed a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation).  
- Revision total hip arthroplasty was performed with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups.  
- Post-surgery, the patient experienced early symptoms of infection, including high fever, suppuration, no wound healing, and laboratory abnormalities.  
- Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful.  
- A two-stage replacement of the endoprosthesis femur was planned.  
- In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed.  
- Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed.  
- The patient was referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for the assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure.

**Assessment/Plan:**  
The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Initial attempts to cover the defect with a lateral gastrocnemius flap were unsuccessful due to the highly scarred surrounding area and atrophic gastrocnemius muscle. No other local flaps were large enough to cover the defect, necessitating the use of a free flap. However, there was a lack of suitable receptor vessels, and the descending genicular artery was found to be small in caliber with calcified plaques, rendering it unsuitable.

**Family Concerns:**  
The patient's family expressed concern about the patient's condition and were informed about the current situation and treatment plan.
