**Follow-up Visit Post-Surgery**

**Reason for Visit:**  
Follow-up after corrective osteotomy for cubitus varus deformity.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with a cubitus varus deformity of the left elbow, which developed following a fracture around the elbow at the age of 8. The fracture was managed conservatively with a plaster cast after closed reduction. The patient had a 15Â° cubitus varus deformity, full range of elbow movements, and no distal neural deficit. Radiographs showed an oblique joint line and evidence of an old healed remodeled fracture line. Two foramina of 3-4 mm diameter were observed on anteroposterior view on a vertical plane, with the distal hole having sharp margins and the proximal having indistinct margins. Similar holes were seen in the oblique view.

**Surgical Details:**  
During the corrective osteotomy, a lateral approach to the elbow was used. Upon lifting the periosteum, an anomalous structure was noticed entering the bone on the medial side of the supracondylar region. Initially thought to be the median nerve, further dissection revealed it to be the radial nerve, which was severely entrapped in the bone and transected during the attempt to remove it. Both the median and ulnar nerves were explored and found intact, but the radial nerve was not found in its normal course. The osteotomy was completed as planned, and the wound was closed. The radial nerve was deemed non-repairable and was not repaired.

**Post-Operative Course:**  
Post-operatively, the function of both the ulnar and median nerves was normal, but the patient exhibited radial nerve palsy. The elbow was mobilized after 1 week.

**Plan:**  
The patient is advised to continue physical therapy and follow-up regularly to monitor progress. Further evaluation and management of the radial nerve palsy will be considered as needed.
