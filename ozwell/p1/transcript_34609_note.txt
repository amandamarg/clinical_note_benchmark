**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:08:15 PM  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient reported experiencing these symptoms for the past few days. 

**Past Medical History:**  
The patient had a road traffic accident 18 months ago, resulting in a severe head injury and pelvic fracture. Since the accident, the patient experienced occasional episodes of anterior chest pain and dyspnea on moderate exertion.

**Recent Events:**  
The patient was admitted to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. A CT chest with intravenous contrast revealed a large aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta causing compression on the origin of the left main bronchus and on the right and left pulmonary arteries. The patient was referred to the vascular surgical unit for further management.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, the patient had mild shortness of breath. Vital signs and routine blood investigations were within normal limits. A chest radiograph showed normal bilateral lung fields. An endoluminal thoracic aortic stenting was performed under general anesthesia. Post-procedure, the patient complained of severe dyspnea and was desaturating. An immediate post-procedure chest X-ray revealed complete collapse of the left lung. An urgent CT chest with intravenous contrast showed the aneurysmal sac completely occluding the left main bronchus with complete collapse of the left lung but with adequate perfusion. The aneurysmal sac also caused mass compression on the adjacent right main pulmonary artery, which was compressed and stretched maximally at its proximal portion. The patient was stable hemodynamically with relatively acceptable arterial blood gases. 

**Management Plan:**  
The patient was monitored closely for possible emergency intervention with an endobronchial stent. However, placement of an endobronchial stent in the left main bronchus could increase pressure and occlude the compressed right pulmonary artery supplying the only aerated right lung, potentially causing major morbidity. Therefore, a conservative plan was adopted. After 18 hours, the apex of the left lung started to open up radiologically. The patient will continue to be monitored closely.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient will be kept under close observation, and any further developments will be communicated.

**Patient's Questions/Concerns:**  
The patient did not have any additional questions or concerns at this time.

**Physician's Note:**  
The patient will be monitored closely, and we will ensure to provide the best care possible.
