**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:22:03 PM  

**Patient History:**  
The patient reports experiencing weakness in the limbs and bladder problems for the past 18 months, which began after a fall in the bathroom. Initially diagnosed with degenerative cervical spondylotic myelopathy with OPLL and central cord syndrome, the patient opted for conservative treatment over surgical intervention. The conservative treatment included a rehabilitation program with gait training, balance exercises, and counseling against fall prevention, but resulted in very little improvement.

**Surgical History:**  
After a year of conservative treatment, the patient underwent surgery at another center, which involved an anterior C5 cervical corpectomy with mesh cage, bone grafting, and anterior cervical plating. Post-surgery, the patient's neurological status remained unchanged, though they were otherwise doing well.

**Post-Surgical Symptoms:**  
The patient experienced mild neck pain, insidious in onset, non-progressive, aggravated by activity, and relieved with rest, with no diurnal variations or associated systemic symptoms. Radiographs of the cervical spine revealed that the screws of the anterior cervical plate had loosened and backed out.

**Additional Symptoms:**  
The patient reported difficulty swallowing, particularly with solid foods, and throat pain. There were no symptoms of fever, respiratory difficulty, or swelling. While the difficulty in swallowing resolved, odynophagia persisted to some extent.

**Follow-Up Imaging:**  
A subsequent radiograph showed that one of the screws was missing and the plate was completely backed out. The patient was instructed to wear a rigid cervical collar to prevent further backing out of the screws. A chest radiograph and CT chest were performed to locate the missing screw, but it was not found.
