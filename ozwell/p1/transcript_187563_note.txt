**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient's Name]  
- **Age:** [Patient's Age]  
- **Gender:** Male  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Pain and swelling on the right cheek for three months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling on the right cheek for the past three months. He has been taking analgesics and antibiotics, but the symptoms have worsened.

**Medical History:**  
- Fit and healthy young man with no relevant medical history or known allergies.  
- Previous surgery: Bimaxillary orthognathic surgery a year and a half ago. The postoperative period was uneventful.

**Surgical History:**  
During the bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, a dislodged orthodontic appliance was noted. The molar tube from the right maxillary second molar was found missing and confirmed to be high up in the right maxillary-zygomatic buttress area via postoperative X-ray. Further radiographs confirmed its location outside the right maxillary antrum. Due to pronounced postoperative facial oedema, no attempt was made to remove the appliance, and it was left in-situ with continuous clinical observation.

**Examination:**  
- Sinus with slight pus discharge observed on the upper right buccal sulcus region adjacent to the upper right first premolar.  
- All teeth in the affected quadrant are firm and vital.  
- Tenderness upon palpation on the upper right vestibular region.

**Assessment:**  
The sinus track may originate from the dislodged appliance embedded in the cheek soft tissue.

**Plan:**  
Further tests are required to confirm the need for removal of the appliance to prevent further complications. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to discuss test results and any necessary procedures.
