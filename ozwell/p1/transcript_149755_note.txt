**Subjective:**
The patient was involved in a road traffic accident resulting in a crush injury to the left leg under a truck tire. The patient reported experiencing significant pain at the time of the incident.

**Objective:**
- **Injury Description:** Grade IIIb compound fracture of the tibia with a 20cm by 8cm wound over the anteromedial side of the lower third of the tibia, extending to the medial side of the ankle joint and foot. The periosteum was exposed in the lower third of the tibia, and the wound was badly contaminated.
- **Radiographic Findings:** Distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia that was further comminuted. The fibula fracture was at the same level as the tibia and was a short oblique fracture.

**Assessment:**
- Immediate debridement was performed within 2 hours of injury, with thorough washing and removal of all dead and devitalized tissue. A biplanar external fixator was used to fix the fracture.
- Regular wound dressing and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Two additional debridements were necessary.
- At 4 weeks post-injury, the wound was healthy enough for a cross-leg flap procedure.
- At 3 weeks post-flap surgery, the external fixator was removed due to multiple pin track infections, and the limb was immobilized in a long leg cast.
- At 3.5 months post-injury, the wound was healthy. Radiographs indicated good union response at the proximal end of the segmental tibia fragment, but the distal end showed non-bridging callus formation.
- Abnormal mobility at the fracture site necessitated stabilization, but the soft tissue condition precluded internal fixation. The fibula fracture was completely united.

**Plan:**
- Posterior bone grafting along with bridge fibula grafting was performed to provide additional stability at the non-union site. A lateral approach was used, and cancellous graft from the right iliac crest was placed in the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula at the non-union site.
- Continued monitoring of the patient's progress with follow-up appointments as needed.

**Follow-up:**
- The patient will be monitored closely, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess healing and progress.
