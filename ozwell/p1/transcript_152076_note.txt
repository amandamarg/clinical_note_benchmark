**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 6:59:57 PM  

**Patient Complaint:**  
The patient presented with a hole in the upper jaw, persisting for the past 2 years.

**History:**  
The patient has been wearing a denture constructed 10 years ago continuously, only removing it for cleaning.

**Examination Findings:**  
- Perforation in the palate measuring approximately 2.5 cm × 2 cm, initially presenting as an erythematous patch and developing into a fistula over the past 2 years.
- On palpation, the margins were non-tender, and surrounding tissues appeared normal in color and texture.
- Water gargling resulted in water escaping through the nose.
- Maxillary occlusal radiograph showed loss of bone from the mid-palate region.

**Medical History:**  
- Uneventful medical history.
- Blood investigations within normal limits.
- Serological investigations negative for venereal diseases.

**Plan:**  
- Immediate discontinuation of the denture.
- Surgical intervention planned: Palatal rotational flap surgery.
  - Procedure to be performed under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation.
  - Patient to be placed in a supine position with neck extended using a pillow under the shoulder.
  - Local anesthesia with adrenaline to be injected around the lesion for hemostasis.
  - Margins of the fistula to be excised to remove the epithelial lining.
  - Palatal flap design to be planned based on the course of the greater palatine artery and marked according to the site and size of the defect.
  - A partial thickness flap to be raised and rotated laterally to cover the defect, secured with 3–0 black silk sutures.
  - Donor area to be left open for secondary epithelization, covered by the periosteum of the palatal bone.
  - Beta dine dressing to be applied over the entire area.

**Postoperative Care:**  
- One week postoperative review expected to show healing of the defect area without infection or dehiscence, with the donor site covered with normal fibrin.

**Patient Understanding and Agreement:**  
The patient acknowledged understanding of the procedure and postoperative expectations.
