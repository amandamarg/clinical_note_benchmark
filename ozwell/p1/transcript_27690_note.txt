**Clinical Note**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. Smith  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient was admitted to the ICU due to an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient presented with significant back pain and swelling in the left leg. The patient has a history of severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and had previously undergone a stenting procedure in the left leg and amputation of the left third toe. The patient also sustained an acute fracture in the tenth thoracic vertebra and underwent spinal fusion.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Left leg: Swollen, cool to the touch, with a mottled skin appearance.  
- Pedal pulses: Completely absent on palpation.

**Diagnostic Tests:**  
- Doppler test: Absence of pedal pulses.  
- CTA of the abdominal aorta: Occlusion of the stent in the left leg.  
- Duplex ultrasound: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg.

**Assessment:**  
The patient developed phlegmasia cerulea dolens due to extensive DVT in the left leg. Despite starting heparin treatment 7 hours after symptom development, the chances of limb salvage were very small due to the patient's history of PAD. Thrombolysis was contraindicated due to the recent subarachnoid hemorrhage and spinal surgery. A minimally invasive procedure was considered after comprehensive multidisciplinary discussions, including a second expert opinion from a peripheral interventional cardiologist.

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the patient's condition closely.  
- Keep the patient and family updated on any changes.  
- Provide supportive care and address any concerns or questions from the patient and family.

**Outcome:**  
Despite best efforts, the patient's condition worsened, and he passed away. The family was informed of the situation and provided with explanations regarding the patient's medical condition and treatment efforts.

**Family Discussion:**  
The family was informed of the patient's passing and the medical circumstances leading to it. They were encouraged to reach out with any further questions or concerns.
