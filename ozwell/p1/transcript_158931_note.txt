**Clinical Note**

**Patient Information:**
- Age: 12 months
- Gender: Female

**Chief Complaint:**
- Abdominal mass

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient was referred to the pediatric oncology department due to the presence of an abdominal mass. The family first noticed asymmetry in the patient's legs at three months of age, with the right leg being thicker and approximately 2 cm longer than the left leg. The right cheek was also slightly fuller than the left, and the right arm and forearm were thicker than their counterparts on the left. A hip ultrasonography was performed, showing no evidence of hip dislocation, and an orthopedic surgeon ruled out a hip problem. The family was initially told the asymmetry was constitutional and would not harm the child. At 12 months, the patient developed macroscopic hematuria, prompting further investigation.

**Birth History:**
- Born weighing 3.5 kg after an uneventful pregnancy.

**Physical Examination:**
- Weight: 90th percentile
- Length: 75th percentile
- Asymmetry noted in cheeks, arms, and legs.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan confirmed a cystic/solid mass of 10 cm in diameter at the right kidney, consistent with Wilms tumor.
- The left renal vein and inferior vena cava were free of tumor infiltration.
- The right kidney was normal with no evidence of further complications.

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood pressure and other vital signs were normal.

**Assessment:**
- The findings are consistent with Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer affecting children. The absence of tumor infiltration in the left renal vein and inferior vena cava is a positive indicator that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

**Plan:**
- Further tests and treatments will be conducted to manage the Wilms tumor. Detailed explanations and answers to any questions will be provided to the family.
