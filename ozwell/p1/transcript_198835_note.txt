**Patient:** [Patient's Name]  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a sensitive mass on the right wrist, which has been present for approximately three years. The mass has increased in size over time, and the associated pain has worsened. The patient reports sensitivity to light contact on the area but denies any cold sensitivity. There is no history of trauma to the area. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsal-radial aspect of the hand, which was treated. Post-treatment, the patient developed reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), affecting hand mobility. A stellate ganglion block was attempted without relief, and the patient has been performing home exercises to improve range of motion.

**Objective:**  
Physical examination revealed a small, round nodule measuring approximately 5mm x 5mm on the right wrist, which was tender and painful to touch. There was no pain radiation or Tinel's sign noted. Imaging studies showed no abnormalities except for some osteopenia. During surgery, a maroon-colored mass connected to a cutaneous nerve branch was excised. The ulnar nerve and dorsal sensory branch were confirmed not to be involved. Postoperatively, the patient reported being pain-free and satisfied with the surgical outcome.

**Assessment:**  
The patient was diagnosed with a glomus tumor, confirmed by strong reactivity to immunostaining of type IV collagen and smooth muscle actin.

**Plan:**  
The tumor was successfully removed, and the patient is expected to have no further issues related to it. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition closely.

**Family:**  
The patient's family expressed gratitude for the care provided.
