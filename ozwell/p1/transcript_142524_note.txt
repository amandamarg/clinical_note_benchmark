**Clinical Note:**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name]  
**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Physician:** [Doctor's Name]  

**Subjective:**  
The patient reports feeling unwell. They have a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The patient was initially started on peritoneal dialysis but had to switch to hemodialysis following a severe episode of peritonitis. The patient's plans for renal transplantation were unsuccessful due to the sudden passing of their mother from a heart attack.

**Objective:**  
The patient has experienced complications with dialysis care, including recurrent vascular access thrombosis, necessitating the use of catheters for renal replacement therapy due to difficulties with fistulas and grafts. The patient has also had recurrent septic states with seizures and bacteremia, particularly during the first hour of hemodialysis sessions. Antibiotic locking with cephazolin or gentamicin was used at the end of hemodialysis sessions. The patient suffered from severe malnutrition due to long-term infectious states and inefficient hemodialysis, requiring support with parenteral nutrition, more frequent hemodialysis sessions, and intravenous antibiotics.

**Assessment:**  
The patient has been through significant challenges, including a confirmed presence of antiphospholipid antibodies through a thrombophilia screen, leading to a diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS). The patient is currently anticoagulated.

**Plan:**  
Continue with the current treatment plan, including anticoagulation therapy, and monitor the patient's response to treatment. Provide ongoing support and management of dialysis-related complications and nutritional needs.  

**Comments:**  
The patient has endured a prolonged period of suffering due to their medical conditions and complications. We will continue to provide the necessary treatment and support to improve their quality of life.
