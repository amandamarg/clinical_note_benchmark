**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. X  
**Physician:** Dr. Y  
**Date:** 10/1/2025

**Chief Complaint:**  
Right sciatic nerve palsy and a mass in the right posterior thigh.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mrs. X was admitted to the hospital with right sciatic nerve palsy and a mass in the right posterior thigh. She reports experiencing sciatica for the past 6 months. Previous evaluations at another hospital included X-rays and an MRI of the lower back, which revealed stenosis. Despite treatment with medications, her symptoms worsened, leading to sciatic nerve palsy 3 weeks ago.

**Physical Examination:**  
A soft tissue mass was palpated in the posterior thigh, accompanied by pain and a drop foot with concomitant sensory loss. The patella tendon reflex was normal, while the Achilles tendon reflex was negative.

**Laboratory and Imaging Studies:**  
Routine blood tests returned normal. Radiographs indicated a radiolucent area in the posterior thigh without calcification. MRI findings showed a mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous high intensity on T2-weighted images. Gadolinium enhancement confirmed the mass originated from the sciatic nerve. CT scans showed no evidence of metastasis.

**Past Medical History:**  
Mrs. X underwent a partial gastrectomy 2 years ago for a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 8.5 x 8 cm, with no lymph node involvement. She declined adjuvant chemotherapy due to her age.

**Surgical Intervention:**  
A surgical resection of the sciatic nerve mass was performed, assuming a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma. A segmental resection of the sciatic nerve was conducted due to complete paralysis and to achieve an adequate margin. Intraoperative findings revealed the sciatic nerve was tightly surrounded by the mass, which strongly compressed the peripheral muscles. Histological examination confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with the previous diagnosis.

**Plan:**  
Mrs. X is to return for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor her progress post-surgery. Further management will be based on her recovery and any additional findings.
