**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 8:20:56 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **History:** Prior cesarean delivery for arrest of active labor at 7 cm.  

**Reason for Admission:**  
- Induction of labor due to abnormal antenatal testing.  

**Counseling:**  
- Patient underwent extensive counseling and chose to undergo a TOLAC (Trial of Labor After Cesarean).  

**Cervical Exam:**  
- 2 cm dilation and 50% effacement.  

**Induction Method:**  
- Labor induced with oxytocin.  
- Amniotomy performed at 5 cm dilation with clear fluid noted.  

**Labor Progression:**  
- Progressed from 2 cm to 5 cm over 10 hours.  
- Interval time to progression to 6 cm was 3.5 hours.  

**Complications During Labor:**  
- Moderate amount of vaginal bleeding.  
- Minimal fetal heart rate variability and variable decelerations not improved with intrauterine resuscitation.  

**Intervention:**  
- Taken to the operating room for repeat cesarean delivery due to concern for uterine rupture and/or placental abruption.  

**Cesarean Delivery Findings:**  
- No uterine rupture or dehiscence.  
- No significant placental abruption.  
- Delivered a male infant weighing 2659 g.  
- Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively.  
- Arterial cord pH was 7.26.  
- No extension of the hysterotomy noted following delivery.  

**Post-Delivery Findings:**  
- Bladder noted to be distended and edematous despite a patent Foley catheter.  
- Vaginal exam prompted to evaluate the integrity of the lower uterine segment behind the bladder.  

**Vaginal Exam Findings:**  
- Spontaneous detachment of the anterior rim of the cervix from approximately 9 to 3 o'clock.  
- Avulsed portion of cervix appeared necrotic.  
- No bleeding noted at the site of cervical detachment.  

**Subsequent Intervention:**  
- Attempt to repair the site of detachment vaginally resulted in complete detachment of the cervix.  
- No excessive bleeding noted.  

**Conclusion:**  
- Cesarean delivery completed successfully.  
- Further management required for cervical detachment.
