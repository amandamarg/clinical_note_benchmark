**Chief Complaint:**  
Seizures

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient first presented at the age of 5 with an episode of convulsion, loss of consciousness, and hemiplegia on the left side. A CT scan and angiography were performed, and the patient was managed conservatively. A year later, the patient returned with improved power in the left limbs to Grade 3-4 out of 5 and was able to walk with some support. An MRI at that time showed resolution of the hematoma and the presence of a gliotic cavity.

At the age of 9, the patient experienced intermittent episodes of seizures. An MRI showed the gliotic cavity on T1 weighted scan and some abnormal vessels on T2 weighted image. An MR angiogram revealed an arteriovenous malformation. Surgery was advised, but the patient's parents declined due to the intermittent nature of the seizures.

A year later, the patient returned with intractable seizures. A digital subtraction angiography confirmed the presence of the arteriovenous malformation. Surgical resection of the arteriovenous malformation was performed.

**Past Medical History:**

- MRI and MR angiogram at age 9 showing gliotic cavity and arteriovenous malformation
- Digital subtraction angiography confirming arteriovenous malformation

**Surgical History:**  
- Resection of arteriovenous malformation
