**Clinical Note**

**Date:** 10/1/2025  
**Time:** 7:19:18 PM  

**Patient Information:**  
- **Chief Complaint:** Pain in the right breast.  
- **History of Present Illness:** The patient was admitted to the hospital for a large mass in the right breast. The patient first noticed the mass a year ago as a small bump, initially thought to be a cyst. The primary care physician described it as a bulging, red breast mass measuring at least 8 cm. Biopsies revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm with dominant features of carcinoma and a suggestion of carcinosarcoma. The patient did not undergo treatment initially, allowing the mass to enlarge and ulcerate through the skin with centralized necrosis and bleeding. The patient has experienced a 50-pound weight loss over the previous 6 months and intermittent low-grade fevers.  

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension  
- Deaf in the left ear  

**Surgical History:**  
- No significant surgical history prior to the current condition.  

**Family History:**  
- Not significant for malignancies in any first-degree relatives.  

**Physical Examination:**  
- The patient was in a lot of pain. There was a large, extensively necrotic mass on the right anterolateral breast and chest wall. The necrotic tissue was on an erythematous, dense mound of tissue extending to the lateral and central chest wall. No cervical, supraclavicular, left axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted, but there was palpable lymphadenopathy within the right axilla.  

**Treatment:**  
- The patient underwent a right radical mastectomy, which involved the removal of the entire pectoralis major and minor musculature down to the right chest wall, and a complete level III axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The skin flaps were viable, not grossly involved with the tumor, and were able to be closed primarily.  

**Recovery:**  
- The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged two days later.  

**Current Symptoms:**  
- The patient has developed a moderate amount of right upper extremity chronic lymphedema.  

**Plan:**  
- Monitor the patient's chronic lymphedema.  

**Follow-Up:**  
- The patient did not have any questions at this time and will be seen again soon.
