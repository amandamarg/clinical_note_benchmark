**Subject:** Ventral Hernia Reconstruction

**History of Presenting Illness:** The patient presents today for evaluation and planned reconstruction of a ventral hernia.

**Past Medical History:** The patient has a significant history following a traumatic injury approximately 4 months prior. He was admitted to General Surgery for management of full-thickness burn wounds resulting from contact with a high-tension electric wire. This resulted in burns to the right scapula, right upper limb, and anterior abdominal wall. He also experienced intestinal perforation with associated intestinal loop prolapse through the abdominal wound, requiring 3 days of initial management before referral to our Plastic Surgery Unit. 

**Hospital Course:** Upon presentation to our unit, the patient was in septic shock and required an abdominal drain. He was subsequently managed with intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, barrier dressing of the abdominal wound, and culture-specific antibiotics. He responded well to conservative management. Following stabilization, a thorough debridement of necrotic skin over the right shoulder and upper arm was performed, followed by split-skin grafting. An enterocutaneous fistula developed and healed over a period of 8 weeks. The abdominal wound was covered with a skin graft, and the patient was discharged after 18 days.

**Current Presentation:** The patient now presents for planned ventral hernia reconstruction.

**Plan:** The patient will undergo ventral hernia reconstruction utilizing a synthetic mesh and flap cover. During the procedure, the abdominal skin graft will be separated from the peritoneum and underlying omentum, and an inlay composite mesh will be applied. 

**Post-operative Notes:** Following mesh application, the flap failed. Therefore, we performed debridement and applied two random pattern transposition skin flaps - one from the right upper abdomen and another from the left lower abdomen.
