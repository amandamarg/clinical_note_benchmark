**Subject:** Evaluation of Wound Dehiscence and Hardware Exposure – Left Knee

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presents to our department today for evaluation of wound dehiscence and hardware exposure on her left knee. She reports persistent pain in the wound.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a history of a prior total left hip arthroplasty performed at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain. Eight years post-op, she presented to orthopedics with progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly during ambulation, leading to difficulty with deambulation. Radiographic examination revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component.

Subsequent to the initial hip arthroplasty, the patient experienced early symptoms of infection approximately three weeks post-operatively, including high fever, suppuration, and failure of wound healing, accompanied by laboratory abnormalities. Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful, necessitating a staged revision total hip arthroplasty. 

During the first stage of the revision, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. 

The patient was subsequently referred to our unit four weeks post-last surgery for evaluation of wound dehiscence to the left knee with hardware exposure.

**Current Presentation:**

Today, the patient presents with a wound dehiscence and hardware exposure on her left knee. A lateral gastrocnemius flap was considered but deemed unsuitable due to significant scarring and atrophic muscle. A free flap was ultimately chosen, however, the descending genicular artery was found to be small caliber and calcified. A retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap was performed.
