**Subject:** Persistent Peritoneal Effusion and Post-Transplant Response

**History of Presenting Illness:** 

Mr. [Patient’s Name] presents today with a history of persistent nausea and cloudy peritoneal fluid, initially noted approximately 7 months after initiating automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) in February 2015. 

**Clinical Findings:**

*   **Symptoms:** Patient reports nausea and cloudy peritoneal fluid.
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   Peritoneal effluent white cell count: 996 cells/mL, polymorphonuclear cell fraction: 56%.
    *   Microbiological investigation of peritoneal fluid: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to beta lactams, sensitive to vancomycin.
*   **Treatment:** Patient received intravenous vancomycin 2 g and ceftazidime 1.5 g as per hospital empiric protocol. Ceftazidime was discontinued after 2 doses. Vancomycin was continued intravenously every 4 days for a total of 3 weeks, with a dose adjusted to maintain serum vancomycin levels greater than 25 mg/L, peaking at 35 mg/L, due to planned live donor kidney transplant.
*   **Post-Treatment Reaction:** One day after completing vancomycin, patient developed general malaise, diffuse blanchable papular rash (trunk and proximal limbs) with intense pruritus and pain.
*   **Vital Signs (at onset of reaction):** Hypotensive with mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mm Hg, heart rate 115, temperature T 39.1°C.
*   **Rash Appearance:** Diffuse blanchable papular rash involving the trunk and proximal limbs without blistering or sloughing, no mucous membrane involvement, no lymphadenopathy.
*   **Subsequent Management:** Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension requiring vasopressors, treated for possible sepsis with intravenous saline and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin), and subsequently underwent a skin biopsy.


**Additional Findings:**

*   **Imaging:** All imaging was normal.
*   **Blood and Urine Cultures:** Negative.
*   **Skin Biopsy:** Revealed a moderate mixed perivascular infiltrate, composed mostly of lymphocytes with a few neutrophils and scattered eosinophils, and a moderate amount of both vacuolar and a slightly lichenoid interface dermatitis.

**Plan:** 

Consultation with colleagues will be arranged to further evaluate this complex presentation. Patient to continue monitoring closely for any changes. Patient to report any further symptoms or concerns immediately.
