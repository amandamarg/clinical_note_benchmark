**Subject:** Right Mandibular Swelling & Garre’s Osteomyelitis

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today reporting a swelling in the right jaw, noted approximately three months ago due to a periapical infection. Patient reports previous antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful.

**Examination Findings:**

*   **Clinical Examination:** Significant swelling in the right jaw with no fluctuation upon palpation. Submandibular lymphadenopathy was noted in the right mandibular region. Skin color and appearance were normal.
*   **Oral Examination:** Deep caries cavity present in the right mandibular first molar tooth, tooth is not mobile.
*   **Radiographic Examination:** Deep caries cavity and radiolucent area in the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Lamellar appearance on the external cortical surface of the mandible at the lower edge of the mandibular corpus with focal new bone formation.
*   **Cone-Beam Computed Tomography:** Identified a tunnel-like defect in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, starting from the apical region of the right mandibular first molar tooth. Bone deposition was noted at the radiolucent area in the center at the lower edge of the mandible and the vestibule surface in this region.

**Diagnosis:** Garre’s osteomyelitis secondary to periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Treatment Plan:**  Due to patient’s location and financial constraints, endodontic treatment was deemed inappropriate. Dental extraction of the right mandibular first molar tooth is the recommended treatment plan.
