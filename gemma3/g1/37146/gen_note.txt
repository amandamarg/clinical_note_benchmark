**Subjective:**

Patient presents today for follow-up regarding chronic left hip and groin pain of three years duration. Patient reports persistent pain.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient has experienced chronic left hip and groin pain for the past three years.

**Past Medical History:** No prior history of thrombotic events. Patient reports a prior hand surgery with no perioperative complications.

**Medications:** Patient was on oral contraceptives at the time of the initial MRI study, which were subsequently discontinued. Currently on warfarin.

**Social History:** Patient is a lifetime nonsmoker.

**Family History:** Non-contributory.

**Review of Systems:**  No acute symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

**Physical Examination:** Examination revealed no evidence of leg swelling or asymmetry or postthrombotic syndrome.

**Diagnostic Testing:**

*   **Initial MRI (3 years prior):** Revealed distention of the left common and external iliac veins.
*   **Left Lower Limb Ultrasound (3 weeks prior to todayâ€™s appointment):** No evidence of deep vein thrombosis, including the common femoral and external iliac veins.
*   **MR Angiogram and Venogram:** Revealed significant narrowing of the upper aspect of the left common iliac vein just as it passed under the right common iliac artery before it joined with the right iliac vein. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.  The remaining left iliac veins were unremarkable for compression or malformation. Pressure measurements demonstrated a mean pressure gradient across the stenosis.
*   **Pelvic Venogram:** Illustrated stenosis of the left common iliac vein consistent with external compression with some collateral veins.
*   **Thrombophilia Screen:** Patient is heterozygous for Factor V Leiden mutation.

**Assessment:** Chronic left hip and groin pain, likely secondary to iliac vein compression, consistent with findings on MR angiogram, venogram, and pelvic venogram. 

**Plan:** Continue warfarin therapy for six months.  Patient will return for follow-up in six months.
