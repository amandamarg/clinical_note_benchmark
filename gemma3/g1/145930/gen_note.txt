**Date:** [Date - Not Provided in Dialogue]
**Subject:** Dental Evaluation & Recommendations

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presents today complaining of dissatisfaction with the appearance of their teeth. Patient reports a 4-year history of missing teeth in both the upper and lower arches. There was no reported trauma or prior extractions. Patient states their teeth exfoliated due to loosening.

**Examination Findings:**

*   **Clinical Examination:** Intraoral examination revealed normal morphologic appearance and color of permanent teeth, with generalized grade II and grade III mobility in the maxillary arch from the right canine region to the left canine region, and complete incisor loss in the mandibular arch. Oral hygiene was noted to be poor with significant plaque and calculus deposits in all quadrants. Existing restorations were observed on the left maxillary first molar and mandibular second molar.
*   **Radiographic Findings:** Panoramic radiograph demonstrates adequate enamel thickness on the cuspal tips of all teeth. The radiograph also reveals a lack of root formation in most teeth, with short, blunted, and malformed roots of only a few millimeters with obliterated pulp chambers. The mandibular first left molar tooth exhibits a taurodontism-like appearance. Periapical radiolucencies were noted in association with the apex of the mandibular left first molar and right first and second molar.
*   **Specimen Examination:** The right maxillary first molar tooth was extracted and sent to the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology for examination. The gross specimen revealed an intact tooth crown measuring approximately 7.5 mm, with short roots.

**Assessment:**

Patient presents with significant missing teeth and compromised dental health. The patient’s oral hygiene is currently poor, contributing to the generalized mobility. The radiographic findings highlight the extent of root abnormalities.

**Plan:**

1.  **Extraction:** Recommend extraction of mobile teeth.
2.  **Rehabilitation:** Advise on rehabilitation of the missing teeth with a prosthesis.
3.  **Oral Hygiene Instructions:** Provide detailed dietary and oral hygiene instructions.
4.  **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment for ongoing evaluation and treatment planning.
