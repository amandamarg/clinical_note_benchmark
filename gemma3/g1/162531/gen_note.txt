**Patient Name:** [Patient Name - Not Provided]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Not Provided]
**Subject:** Palatal Swelling & Maxillary Sinus

**History of Presenting Illness:**
The patient reports persistent pain and purulent discharge in the upper left jaw for the past 1.5 years, originating after extraction of maxillary molars performed by a local dentist due to pain and tooth mobility.

**Past Medical History:**
The patient is a known hypertensive, currently managed with medication for the past three years. He reports a former smoking habit, which he quit approximately two years ago.

**Physical Examination:**
Extraoral examination revealed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a solitary erythematous swelling with diffuse borders involving the left posterior portion of the hard palate and soft palate, extending from the mesial aspect of the first premolar to 1 cm posterior to the tuberosity on the left side, involving the palatal area but not crossing the midline. An oro-antral communication with purulent discharge was noted. The swelling was nontender to palpation. 

**Diagnostic Findings:**
*   CT scan revealed complete obliteration of the left maxillary sinus.
*   Incisional biopsy of the palate and sinus lining revealed fibrous stroma with areas of hyalinization. Islands of uniform cells arranged in a cord-like pattern with hyperchromatic nuclei were seen enclosing round to oval pseudocystic spaces in the stroma. Tumor cells were also seen arranged in the form of solid islands and ductal pattern. The present case showed all the three histological types. There was no evidence of perineural invasion even on serial sectioning. 

**Clinical Differential Diagnosis:** Benign or malignant neoplasm of minor salivary glands or neoplasm of the maxillary sinus.

**Plan:**
Close monitoring of the patientâ€™s condition is warranted. Follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks.
