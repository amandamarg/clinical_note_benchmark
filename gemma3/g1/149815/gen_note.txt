## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing - Add Here*]
**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Assuming today’s date)
**Physician:** Dr. Smith

**Subject:** Post-Hospital Admission – Hip Fracture & Urological Complications

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented today reporting continued discomfort following a fall from a bridge two days prior, resulting in a severe hip injury. Patient was admitted to the hospital on [Date - *Information Missing - Add Here*] due to the injury.

**Physical Exam Findings:** Patient reports pain in the hip. Examination revealed swelling at the hip wound.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with a femoral neck fracture with dislocation of the femoral head into the pelvis, confirmed by initial radiology. The patient also presented with hematuria. Due to the hematuria, an anterior dislocation of the femoral head was suspected. A Foley catheter was inserted, and antibiotics were administered. 

The following day, surgery was performed via a lateral approach of the hip with anterior capsulotomy. The femoral head was found in the pelvis and could not be extracted. A 50 mm Austin Moore prosthesis was then implanted, with the femoral head retained as a loose fragment within the pelvis. 

Two days later, the urologist performed a new abdominal approach (Gibson) with retroperitoneal dissection of the common iliac vessels, successfully extracting the femoral head. Following drainage placement, the patient experienced pain, loss of mobility, and swelling at the hip wound. Multiple punctures of the hip extracted a large amount of clear fluid, which was confirmed to have a density and elements consistent with urine. A drainage tube was reinserted into the hip wound, and repeated urological evaluations (urography and endoscopic techniques) were performed. 

During these evaluations, a fistula injury of the ipsilateral ureter was discovered, necessitating internal drainage of the ureter, which was left in situ for three months.  The Moore prosthesis was subsequently removed, and the hip was debrided in preparation for further surgical intervention. 

**Current Status:** Patient is currently being monitored and will receive updates regarding follow-up requirements. 

**Plan:** Continued monitoring of patient’s recovery and adherence to post-operative instructions.
