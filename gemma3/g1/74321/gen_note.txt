**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Right Breast Re-implantation & Thoracic Wall Repair

**History:** Patient is a [Patient Age - *Information Missing from Dialogue*] year old female presenting for right breast re-implantation following a surgical history. Patient was previously referred for this procedure. 

Patient has a significant history of breast cancer. In 1984, she was diagnosed with cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy with subsequent radiochemotherapy. A secondary reconstruction was performed using a silicone implant. In 2015, she was diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma and bilateral pulmonary metastases. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with a wedge resection of the right lung. 

During the VATS procedure, a perforation of the silicone implant and injury to the thoracic wall were noted. The perforated breast implant was removed without a diagnosis of the defect.

**Procedure:** Right breast re-implantation was performed following observation of a minor defect in the thoracic wall and parietal pleura. A pedicled flap was created using the highly vascularized capsule tissue of the breast implant. The anterior part of the capsule was dissected and sutured shut.

**Findings:** Minor defect observed in the thoracic wall and parietal pleura. 

**Plan:** Patient will return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks.
