**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Physician:** Dr. X

**Subject:** Chronic Cervical Pain and Metastatic Disease

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents with a longstanding history of chronic neck pain and headache, dating back approximately 2 months, during which the pain has progressively worsened, particularly at night and in the early morning.

**Past Medical History:**

*   28 years ago – Myocardial infarction.
*   40 pack-year smoking history.

**Examination Findings:**

*   **Previous Examination (Departmental):** Patient previously underwent a physical examination revealing painful neck and limited motion. No sensory or motor deficits in the upper limbs were noted.
*   **Neurological Examination:**  Neurological examination revealed that the patient’s complaints could not be completely explained by the spinal stenosis.

**Imaging Results:**

*   **X-ray (Cervical Spine):** Revealed multi-level degeneration of the cervical spine.
*   **MRI (7 months prior):** Demonstrated a disc protrusion from C4 to C7 and neuroforaminal stenosis with compression of the C6 nerve root.
*   **New MRI (Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*):** Revealed osteolysis of the odontoid process, highly suspicious for metastasis.
*   **CT Scan:** Confirmed stability of the odontoid process.

**Laboratory Results:**

*   Previous physical examination revealed normal general physical examination and lab results.

**Diagnosis:**

*   Multi-level cervical degenerative disease.
*   Suspicious Metastatic Disease (Odontoid Process Osteolysis)
*   Metastatic Disease – Coin lesion suspicious of bronchial carcinoma in the right lung, with evidence of metastases to the pancreas and adrenal glands.

**Outcome:**

The patient reports that the palliative radiochemotherapy has successfully relieved the neck pain and headache.
