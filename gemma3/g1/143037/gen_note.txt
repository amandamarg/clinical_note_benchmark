**Subject:** Chronic Left Facial Pain & Esophageal Cancer Progression

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presented today complaining of chronic left-sided facial pain for the past three months. The pain is described as sharp, lancinating, and throbbing, radiating to the left temple and cheek, and exacerbated by chewing solid foods.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a prior diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, treated with methadone, hydrocodone, and carbamazepine, which were ineffective.

**Social History:** Patient reported weight loss secondary to inability to eat solid foods due to the pain.

**Exam Findings:** Patient was in distress due to facial pain. Physical examination revealed a trigger point over the left masseter muscle and normal temporomandibular joint range of motion. Sensory examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick over the left chin, lower lip, and oral mucosa.

**Imaging:**
*   Prior to this visit, patient underwent a brain MRI and a maxillofacial CT scan, which were unremarkable.
*   A PET scan at another hospital revealed a hypermetabolic mass in the esophagus.
*   A localized mandibular CT scan was subsequently performed and revealed a metastatic lesion in the mandibular bone affecting the inferior alveolar nerve.

**Diagnosis:** Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma, confirmed by imaging studies.

**Plan:** Due to the advanced stage of the disease, treatment options are limited. The focus is on pain management and palliative care to maximize patient comfort.

**Outcome:** Patient ultimately passed away. We provided compassionate care and support throughout his illness.

**Note:** I am sorry for your loss. 

**Sincerely,**

Dr. Smith
