**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Stroke Evaluation and Management

**History of Presenting Illness:** The patient presented to the hospital with sudden onset left-sided weakness and speech difficulty, beginning a few days prior.

**Physical Examination & Initial Assessment:** On arrival, the patientâ€™s NIH Stroke Scale score was 20. CT imaging revealed no established infarct, but a CT angiography demonstrated a thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery.

**Treatment & Response:** The patient was immediately treated with thrombolysis and endovascular mechanical clot removal, resulting in a subsequent NIH Stroke Scale score of 2 within 24 hours. A subsequent brain MRI revealed multiple infarcts with hemorrhages in the right middle cerebral artery territory and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, raising the possibility of an embolic source.

**Further Investigations & Findings:** 
*   Four weeks prior to presentation, the patient reported feeling unwell with a low-grade fever, raised inflammatory markers, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
*   An urgent echocardiogram revealed a mobile mass on the anterior mitral valve leaflet, confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography as a vegetation measuring 11 x 4mm, with mild aortic regurgitation.
*   Intravenous antibiotics were administered for suspected infective endocarditis, but remained unsuccessful due to persistent fever and raised inflammatory markers with sterile blood cultures. Additional studies including virology, a vasculitic screen, and atypical organism serology were negative.
*   Thorax, abdomen, and pelvis CT imaging identified a large pelvic mass (9 x 9 cm), suggestive of a right-sided ovarian tumour with no evidence of metastasis. This imaging also revealed pulmonary, splenic, and renal embolic events with associated infarcts.

**Final Diagnosis:** Multi-systemic embolisation secondary to infective endocarditis (likely originating from the mitral valve vegetation) and a large ovarian tumour. 

**Prognosis:** Unfortunately, despite treatment, the patient experienced a poor clinical response to therapy.
