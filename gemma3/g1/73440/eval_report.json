They describe nearly identical cases! Here's a breakdown of the key similarities:\n\n*   **Patient Presentation:** Both patients present with a history of *presumed* spinocerebellar ataxia and develop right heart failure due to an invasive mediastinal mass.\n*   **Mass Description:** The mass is described as amorphous, invasive, and involving the main and left pulmonary arteries, leading to occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery.\n*   **Symptoms:** Both patients experience bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion.\n*   **Diagnostic Findings:** The diagnostic pathway is nearly identical:\n    *   PET Scan showing FDG avidity.\n    *   Multiple biopsies (initial, second, third) \u2013 all yielding inconclusive results (thrombus, fibrous tissue, myxoid degeneration, etc.).\n    *   Echocardiogram showing right heart failure (dilated atria and ventricles).\n    *   Bronchoscopy also non-diagnostic.\n*   **Treatment:** Both patients ultimately underwent pulmonary artery stenting.\n*   **Final Diagnosis:**  Both patients were ultimately diagnosed with Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD).\n\n\n**The only significant difference** is the detail provided about the final diagnosis and the specifics of the stenting procedure in the second text.\n\n**In short, the two texts describe the exact same medical case.**"}}
