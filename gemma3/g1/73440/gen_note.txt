**Subject:** Follow-up – Spinocerebellar Ataxia & Right Heart Failure

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient reports a history of spinocerebellar ataxia. The patient presented with symptoms of right heart failure secondary to an invasive mediastinal mass involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with near complete occlusion of the pulmonary arteries.

**Symptoms:**

The patient reports bilateral lower extremity edema and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Symptoms began in February 2017.

**Past Medical History:**

Patient reports a history of spinocerebellar ataxia.

**Relevant Examination Findings:**

*   **February 2017 Emergency Department Visit:** The patient presented to the ED and was found to have an amorphous, invasive superior left mediastinal mass involving the main and left pulmonary arteries with occlusion of the left pulmonary arterial tree and severe narrowing of the right pulmonary artery.
*   **Diagnostic Testing:**
    *   **PET Scan:** Demonstrated marked fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the anterior mediastinal mass.
    *   **Biopsies:**
        *   **Initial Pathology:** Revealed only thrombus material and a minute fragment of unremarkable intima.
        *   **Second Biopsy:** Nondiagnostic, notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.
        *   **Third Biopsy:** Nondiagnostic despite seemingly adequate yield, notable only for vessel wall fragments with myxoid degeneration and few small crushed.
*   **Echocardiogram (May 2017):** Showed a severely dilated right atrium and severely dilated right ventricle with the interatrial septum bowing to the left, suggestive of right heart failure.
*   **Bronchoscopy:** Nondiagnostic, notable only for fragments of fibrous tissue with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.

**Plan:**

Schedule a follow-up appointment for continued monitoring and symptom management. Instruct patient to monitor symptoms and return for evaluation if they worsen.
