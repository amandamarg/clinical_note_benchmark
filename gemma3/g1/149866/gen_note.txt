## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Bilateral Hip Pain & Deformity

**History of Present Illness:** 
Patient presents today complaining of inability to walk on both lower limbs for the past three months. The patient reports onset of right groin pain while walking approximately three months ago, characterized by limping and swaying. This progressed to inability to bear weight on the right lower limb. One week later, similar pain developed in the left groin, and inability to bear weight on either lower limb ensued, resulting in the patient becoming bedridden.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Patient exhibits bilateral hip pain and deformity.

**Diagnosis:**
Based on clinical findings and imaging, the patient is diagnosed with coxa vara deformity of the bilateral hips with a possibility of bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the femur neck. Imaging reveals polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with bilateral Shepherdâ€™s crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non-union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur. Evidence of fibrous dysplastic lesions were noted in the shaft of the left tibia.

**Relevant Laboratory Findings:**
All blood and serum biochemical tests, including hemoglobin, total and differential white cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels, and all hormonal studies, were within normal limits. There was no evidence of endocrine disturbance or altered pigmentation, or precocious puberty. 

**Treatment Plan:**
The patient will undergo staged correction of the deformity to realign the head, neck, and shaft, and to achieve valgus at the neck-shaft region and a horizontal configuration neck fracture, increasing the chances of union of the pathological fracture of the neck femur, each side at a time.  Initially, an oblique osteotomy was performed on the right side distal to the greater trochanter.  Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor healing and progress. 

**Prognosis:**  Dependent on successful union of the fracture.
