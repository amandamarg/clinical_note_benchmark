## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Assuming today’s date)
**Subject:** Bladder Cancer Management

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presents today for further management of bladder cancer. Patient reports a longstanding concern regarding bladder cancer, initially presenting with gross hematuria in April 2016. 

**Past Medical History:**

*   Adult onset Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, managed with Metformin.
*   Non-smoker.
*   Past surgical history includes a right inguinal hernia repair.
*   Non-obese.

**Significant Findings:**

Patient reports a history of bladder cancer diagnosed in April 2016, characterized by two papillary tumors (Ta) following gross hematuria. A transurethral resection (TURBT) was performed, with pathology confirming low grade Ta. Subsequent surveillance cystoscopy was negative. 

In October 2016, four LG Ta tumors were identified and resected, followed by six weeks of intravesical mitomycin C chemotherapy. The patient remained tumor-free until August 2018 when multifocal bladder cancer was detected. A subsequent TURBT revealed high grade Ta urothelial cancer with focal carcinoma in situ.  One dose of intravesical MMC was administered postoperatively. 

**Current Symptoms:** 

Patient currently reports nocturia (4 times) and daytime urinary frequency. Prior to the recent TURBT, nocturia was reported as 2 times and there were no daytime voiding complaints. 

**Physical Examination:** 

*   Office flexible cystoscopy performed today revealed areas of necrosis consistent with the previous MMC effect on the bladder urothelium, as well as areas of persistent or new high grade Ta tumor.

**Plan:**

Given the patient's history and current findings, I recommend a bladder preservation approach consisting of a course of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This approach is reasonable given the lack of evidence of tumor invasion into the lamina propria or muscularis propria. 

We will discuss this recommendation further and collaboratively determine the best course of treatment.
