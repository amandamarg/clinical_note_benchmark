Text 1 is more of a formal, concise clinical note.\n*   **Details of Resection:** Text 2 provides significantly more detail about the surgical resection, including the specific ribs removed (8th, 9th, and 10th) and the plastic mesh application. Text 1 simply states \u201cthree ribs were resected, including the 8th and 9th ribs.\u201d\n*   **Timeline:** Text 2 includes a more explicit timeline of events, including the patient returning to work two years after the surgery. Text 1 is more focused on the immediate clinical steps.\n*   **Language:** Text 2 uses more technical medical language and terminology.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI would estimate the overall similarity between the two notes to be approximately **85-90%**. They share the same fundamental clinical scenario and treatment pathway, but differ in their level of detail, narrative style, and technical language.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the comparison, such as the differences in the surgical procedure or the rationale behind the final diagnosis?"}}
