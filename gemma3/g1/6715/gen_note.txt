## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Abdominal Wound & Potential Missed Pathology

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presents today complaining of a discharging wound in the upper abdomen that has been ongoing for approximately one month. The patient reports the initial problem began six months ago following an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college due to three days of abdominal pain. During the initial procedure, a small perforation in the stomach was identified and repaired with an omental patch. However, a subsequent burst abdomen occurred on the fourth post-operative day. Management at that time was conservative, and the bowel was eventually contained. The patient was placed on oral nutrition and was doing well at home until approximately one month ago when a serous discharge began from the upper portion of the split thickness skin graft placed four months prior. 

**Physical Examination:**

*   **Wound:** A 12 cm x 5 cm elliptical patch of skin graft is present over the middle of the abdomen. A small, depressed ulcer of approximately 1 cm x 1 cm is noted in the upper portion of the graft, covered with pale granulation tissue exhibiting serous oozing. Several areas of exuberant pale granulation are also observed.
*   **Scar:** A scar is present at the previous drain site.
*   **Abdomen:** Palpation reveals a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.
*   **Ultrasound:** A left subphrenic collection of size 8 cm x 7 cm is identified.

**Laboratory Findings:**

*   Haemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl
*   Total WBC Count: 11.6 x 103/mm3
*   Total Serum Protein: 7.9 gm/dl
*   Serum Albumin: 3.5 gm/dl

**Assessment:**

Suspect missed pathology following the previous exploratory laparotomy. 

**Plan:**

Patient will continue to change gauge pieces over the wound as instructed. Referred to a specialist for further evaluation and management.
