**HPI:** 
Patient presents today with a history of chronic issues affecting the right thumb, initially presenting in May 2009 following an emergency room visit. The patient reports experiencing worsening pain, redness, and swelling in the right thumb over a one-week period, with no prior similar events or trauma.

**Past Medical History:**
* **May 2009:** Presentation to the Emergency Room for paronychia, diagnosed following incision and drainage. Cultures were positive for *Staphylococcus aureus*. Patient received IV antibiotics and was discharged in stable condition with resolution of symptoms.
* **September 2009:** Four months later, patient presented with pain along the radial aspect of the thumb and with a small amount of granulomatous tissue. Drainage ceased after conservative management, but intermittent pain persisted in the radial aspect of the nail fold and interphalangeal joint. A nail deformity was noted at this time.
* **September 2009:** Biopsy performed revealing moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and pyogenic granuloma.
* **September 2009:** Subsequent re-excision of the nail bed, nail fold, and bone with local flap reconstruction, with resection margins 5mm from the biopsy incision. Final pathology showed two focal areas of squamous cell carcinoma in the bony segment.

**Additional Procedures & Findings:**
* **November 2009:** Amputation at the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Sentinel lymph node biopsy performed, which was negative for malignancy. 
* **November 2009:** 7500 Real Time PCR system utilized for evaluation.
