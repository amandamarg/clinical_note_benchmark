**Subject:** Post-Operative Follow-Up - Pancreatic Cystic Tumor

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presented for follow-up following laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy performed for a cystic tumor in the pancreas. Patient initially reported abdominal pain and difficulty eating, which began approximately three weeks prior to the procedure.

**Examination Findings:** 

*   Patient reported a benign mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas, confirmed by final pathology.
*   Initial chemistry and tumor marker levels were within normal limits.
*   CT scan revealed a slightly septated cystic tumor in the pancreas with no mural nodule, calcification, or eccentrically located mass within the cystic area.
*   The tumor was closely adherent to the remaining splenic vessels.

**Procedure:** Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy performed with trocar placement and robotic assistance. An assistant surgeon utilized laparoscopic instruments through Port 4 for temporary use. Segmental resection of splenic vessels was performed to preserve the spleen, due to close adherence of the tumor.

**Operative Details:**
*   Total operative time: 480 minutes.
*   Blood loss: Approximately 800 mL.
*   No blood transfusion required.
*   Specimen delivered via small vertical incision.

**Post-operative Course:** Patient recovered without complications and returned to an oral diet on the postoperative second day. Drain removed on the fifth day post-operation.

**Investigations:**
*   Color Doppler Ultrasound (CDUS) obtained 14 days post-op showed no evidence of splenic infarction and well-preserved blood flow within the spleen without definitive peripancreatic fluid collection.

**Final Pathology:** The final pathologic examination revealed a benign mucinous cystic neoplasm without any characteristics of malignant potential.

**Prognosis:** Good. 

**Follow-Up:** Patient instructed to contact the office with any questions or concerns.
