## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Assuming provided in dialogue]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Right Inguinal Hernia with Appendix Inclusion

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presented with a 6-week history of a palpable bulge in the right groin.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reports a 6-week history of a right inguinal bulge, initially painful but now asymptomatic. Patient reports a prior hernia repair in 1977, but lacks specific details regarding the procedure or mesh utilization.

**Physical Examination:** Upon examination, a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass was palpated in the right groin, lateral to the pubic tubercle. 

**Diagnostic Studies:**
*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of Abdomen and Pelvis:** Revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix included within the sac.
*   **Laboratory Test:** White blood cell count of 4.7 × 109/L. 

**Treatment:** Surgical intervention performed for right inguinal hernia repair with appendix inclusion.

**Procedure:** Classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.  Due to adhesions, a relaxing incision through the rectus sheath was necessary for entry into the peritoneum. The hernia was composed of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance. Attempted reduction of the appendix failed due to adhesions.

**Post-Operative Course:** Surgery was successful. Patient will be monitored closely for the next few days. Patient anticipates some discomfort and pain, which is expected to subside within a few days.
