## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Note: Patient name not provided in dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Note: Date not provided in dialogue*]
**Subject:** Follow-up for Lung and Vertebral Lesions

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented for a routine checkup. During the examination, a small nodule was identified in the right lung, and a lytic lesion was discovered in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.

**Examination Findings:**
*   Initial examination revealed a small nodule in the right lung.
*   A lytic lesion was noted in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.
*   Laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative.
*   Physical examination was unremarkable aside from the identified lesions.

**Diagnostic Procedures:**
*   CT scan performed, revealing an increase in size of the pulmonary nodule and an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
*   Biopsy samples were obtained but were deemed insufficient for definitive diagnosis, leading to suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.
*   Five years later, a CT scan indicated continued growth of the pulmonary nodule and the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
*   Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and curettage were performed on the pulmonary lesion and lytic bone lesion, respectively.
*   During surgery, the orthopedic surgeons reported that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface, and the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.

**Final Diagnosis:** Patient has persistent pulmonary and vertebral lesions. The tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface, and the vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal. 

**Clinical Course:** Patient has made good postoperative progress and remains free of disease at 41 months following the operation. 

**Plan:** Continued close observation with periodic imaging studies.
