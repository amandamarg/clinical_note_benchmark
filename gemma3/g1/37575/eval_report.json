Text 1 is very brief about this.\n*   **Specific Surgical Details:** Text 2 outlines the precise surgical implants used (Depuy Pinnacle cup, ceramic liner, Corail stem), while Text 1 doesn\u2019t.\n*   **Bone Scan Investigation Details:** Text 2 provides a more specific interpretation of the bone scan findings - attributing the hot uptake to a fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint with diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus.\n*   **Hematological Examination:** Text 2 includes a comprehensive hematological examination and a list of lab values, which is completely absent in Text 1.\n*   **Timeline & Outcome:** Text 2 gives a much longer timeline (17 months post-op) and a positive outcome \u2013 a normal gait and pain-free status. Text 1 simply states the patient is scheduled for follow-up.\n*   **Reduction Loss:** Text 1 notes a \"reduction loss\" two weeks after initial treatment, while Text 2 describes the reduction loss due to non-union.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI\u2019d estimate the two texts share approximately **70-80%** similarity. They\u2019re essentially describing the same clinical scenario, but Text 2 provides a significantly richer and more detailed account of the patient\u2019s journey, investigations, and outcome.\n\nDo you want me to focus on a particular aspect of the similarity (e.g., the treatment plan, the diagnostic findings, or the patient's timeline)?"}}
