**Subject:** Chronic Hip and Ankle Pain – Persistent Findings

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presents today with a history of chronic pain in both hip joints and the left ankle, initially noted several weeks ago. The patient reports the pain began after a two-week training period at a marine training center, involving 2-3 hours of daily swimming (50 minutes of swimming with 10 minutes of rest; 25 meters back and forth four times at full strength followed by the same distance at low speeds) and 2 hours of basic physical strength reinforcement training (walking and running for about an hour followed by weight training). 

**Past Medical History:**

The patient previously visited a private clinic due to the pain, where a radiological examination was performed with no abnormal findings. They were prescribed anti-inflammatory analgesics and recommended immobilization.  The patient subsequently presented at our hospital four weeks after enrollment, reporting aggravation of right hip joint symptoms.

**Examination Findings:**

*   **Radiographs (Right Hip):** Revealed a displaced femoral neck fracture.
*   **Bone Scan (Right & Left Hip, Left Ankle):** Demonstrated hot uptakes at both hips and the left ankle joint.
*   **MRI (Right & Left Hip, Left Ankle):** Revealed fractures of both femoral necks, with the right side exhibiting a displaced and complete fracture. 

**Additional Findings:**

*   **Bone Scan Investigation:** The hot uptake was attributed to a slight fatigue fracture and articular depression of the subtalar joint with diffuse edematous change around the calcaneus.
*   **Ankle:** Patient denies any specific complaints regarding the left ankle joint.
*   **Right Hip:** Two weeks after initial treatment with stabilization and long leg casting, a reduction loss was noted.

**Treatment Plan:**

Patient will require further examination and testing to determine the best course of action.  Patient is scheduled to return for follow-up in a few days.
