**Subject:** Palatal Fistula â€“ Management Plan

**History of Presenting Complaint:** Patient presents today reporting a 2.5 cm x 2 cm perforation in the upper palate, noted over the past 2 years. The initial presentation was an erythematous patch which has evolved into a fistula.

**Examination Findings:**
*   Patient reports wearing a denture constructed 10 years prior, removed only for cleaning.
*   Palpation revealed non-tender margins to the fistula.
*   During a water gargle, the fluid escaped through the nose.
*   Maxillary occlusal radiograph confirmed loss of bone from the mid-palate region.
*   Medical history is uneventful.
*   Blood investigations were within normal limits.
*   Serological investigations were negative for venereal diseases.

**Plan:**
Discontinue denture use immediately.  Planned surgical intervention: Palatal Rotational Flap.

**Procedure:**
Surgical closure of the palatal fistula will be performed under general anesthesia, induced by nasotracheal intubation. The patient will be placed in a supine position with neck extension via a pillow under the shoulder. Local anesthesia with adrenaline will be injected around the lesion for hemostasis. The margins of the fistula will be excised to remove the epithelial lining. A palatal flap design will be planned based upon the course of the greater palatine artery and marked according to the site and size of the defect.  A partial thickness flap will be raised and rotated laterally to cover the defect. The flap will then be secured in its new place using 3-0 black silk sutures. The donor area, which will be covered by the periosteum of the palatal bone, will be left open for secondary epithelization. Beta dine dressing will be applied over the entire area.

**Postoperative Plan:** One week postoperative review will be scheduled to assess healing without infection, dehiscence, and confirm normal fibrin coverage of the donor site.
