**Subject:** Outpatient Consultation - Neck and Back Pain

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presents with neck and lower back pain, accompanied by difficulty maintaining an erect posture.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reports onset of neck and lower back pain approximately four months ago, coinciding with initiation of olanzapine tablets for bipolar affective disorder. The pain is characterized by sustained and abnormal contraction of neck muscles, resulting in a postural deviation with the head consistently turned to the right and upwards. Patient reports a tendency to fall to the side when standing up from a seated position, necessitating the adoption of specific limb positioning to maintain body weight support. The intensity of the pain and dysfunction correlates with the dose of olanzapine.

**Medications:** Olanzapine 2.5-10 mg per day at varying times.  Briefly treated with trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day for rigidity in the upper limbs approximately three weeks prior to this visit.

**Timeline of Symptoms:** Neck and back pain onset approximately four months ago, coinciding with olanzapine initiation at 5 mg daily. Symptoms have persisted for the first three years of the illness with varying intensity, distress, and dysfunction. 

**Other Medications:** Trihexyphenidyl 4 mg per day (used briefly for upper limb rigidity).

**Social History:** Patient requires assistance with standing and walking, and assistance with daily chores is provided by family members.

**Plan:** Order diagnostic tests to determine the etiology of the pain. Will discuss follow-up requirements with the patient.
