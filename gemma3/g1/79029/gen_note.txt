**Subject:** Popliteal Mass & Artery Occlusion

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presents today with a large, painful swelling in his left leg. He reports a history of a popliteal pseudoaneurysm discovered 11 years ago following a puncture wound with a nail.  Initial treatment at another hospital involved excision of the pseudoaneurysm and repair of the popliteal artery. Following the surgery, he experienced a temporary foot drop which resolved spontaneously after one year. Subsequently, a similar mass recurred in the popliteal fossa, prompting further evaluation at cardiovascular surgery.  Current presentation is a significantly enlarged mass associated with an occluded popliteal artery.

**Past Medical History:**
*   11 years ago: Puncture wound with a nail resulting in a popliteal pseudoaneurysm. Treated with excision and repair of the popliteal artery.
*   Temporary foot drop following initial surgery, resolved spontaneously after one year.
*   Recurrence of popliteal mass 5 years ago, managed with observation.

**Physical Examination:**
*   Large mass (28 x 10 cm) noted in the popliteal fossa, accompanied by old surgical scars. The mass is soft, fluctuant, and painless to palpation.
*   Neurological examination of the lower leg is normal.

**Diagnostic Testing:**
*   Arteriography: Shows proximal occlusion of the popliteal artery with filling distal to the occlusion via collateral vessels.
*   MRI: Revealed an enormous soft tissue mass of 115 cm³.
*   Blood Tests: Within normal limits.

**Assessment:**
Large popliteal mass associated with proximal occlusion of the popliteal artery.

**Plan:**
I recommend surgical intervention to remove the mass and repair the popliteal artery.  Close follow-up will be necessary post-operatively.
