They are, in fact, almost verbatim copies of each other. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Identical Content:** Every single detail, from the patient\u2019s age and nationality to the specific interventions performed (retrograde pyelography, ureteroscopy, arteriography, stent graft deployment), is presented in both texts.\n*   **Same Language and Structure:** The phrasing, sentence structure, and overall organization are identical.\n*   **Same Doctor's Note:** Both are written in the style and format of a clinical note from Dr. [Doctor\u2019s Name].\n\n**In short, Text 1 and Text 2 are duplicates.**  It's highly likely they were copied and pasted from the same source."}}
