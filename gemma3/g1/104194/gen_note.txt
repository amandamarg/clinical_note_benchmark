**Patient Name:** Mr. Patient
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Auricular Prosthesis – Follow-up

**History of Present Illness:**

Mr. Patient was referred to our clinic from the Department of Plastic Surgery for fabrication of an auricular prosthesis following a road traffic accident several years ago, resulting in the loss of his right ear. Previous attempts at surgical reconstruction utilizing cartilage and alloplastic graft materials were unsuccessful and were subsequently removed. He was then referred for prosthetic replacement.

**Treatment Plan:**

Following a thorough examination and obtaining informed consent, we agreed upon a two-implant supported custom silicone auricular prosthesis. 

**Procedure:**

Two dental implants were placed at approximately 20 mm distance from the center of the external auditory meatus in the 11:30 and 9:30 o’clock positions. Thinning of the basal tissue bed was performed, considering residual graft material from a previous reconstruction. Following the procedure, the implants were left to heal for 3 months. 

**Post-Operative Findings:**

Fresh cone-beam computed tomography scans revealed tissue thickness ranging from 7–11 mm over both implants. A custom healing abutment was deemed necessary to maintain patency of the passage from the external skin surface to the implant chamber and prevent tissue sagging. Due to uncertainty regarding the precise custom healing abutment, close monitoring of the healing process is warranted. 

**Plan:**

A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in a few weeks to monitor healing. Patient was advised to contact the clinic with any concerns or questions.
