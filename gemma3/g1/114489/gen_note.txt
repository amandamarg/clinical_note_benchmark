**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Post-Craniotomy for Subdural Hematoma and Aneurysm Management

**History of Presenting Illness:** 
Patient presents today with a history of headache initiated several weeks ago following a tackle during exercise. Patient reports a subsequent generalized partial seizure approximately 3 days later. 

**Significant Findings:**
The patient initially underwent a CT scan which revealed a small amount of subdural hematoma on the left cerebral convexity and some calcified nodules at the left frontotemporal cortex. The initial diagnosis was a simple traumatic hemorrhage managed conservatively. However, the headache worsened and a generalized partial seizure occurred. 

Following the seizure, an MRI scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the hematoma and cerebral edema, along with a small enhancing mass at the left cerebral convexity. A Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) test revealed a 4 mm sized aneurysmal dilatation of the cortical branch of the MCA, which supplies the superior temporal region.

**Intervention:** 
Due to the progression of the condition, the patient underwent an emergency craniotomy to eliminate the aneurysm and lower elevated intracranial pressure by removing the hematoma. During the procedure, several irregularly shaped, hard subdural nodules were encountered, tightly adhered to the dura and underlying brain. These nodules were carefully dissected and found to be buried in the sulcus and severely adhered to the cortical arteries. The hematoma was removed via repeated gentle irrigation and suction after a small dural incision, and the organizing hematoma was removed, exposing a pseudoaneurysm of the cortical MCA branch. The aneurysm and the calcified nodules were then excised.

**Post-Operative Course:** 
The patient recovered without sequelae due to adequate collateral flow retrogradely supplying the distal part of the occluded artery, minimizing ischemic injury. Patient was discharged after a short while.
