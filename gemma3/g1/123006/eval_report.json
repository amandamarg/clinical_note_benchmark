The lack of clear venous drainage is a key finding in both.\n*   **Treatment Approach:** Both patients underwent surgical removal of the AVM with its nidus (the feeding vessel).  The surgical techniques (horseshoe incision, flap removal, cauterization) are similar.\n*   **Post-operative Follow-up:** Both notes include a plan for follow-up monitoring.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n*   **Initial Treatment Attempts:** This is the most significant difference. Note 2 details a failed initial surgery performed under local anesthesia, resulting in bleeding and termination of the procedure. Note 1 describes a successful surgery under general anesthesia.\n*   **Treatment Details:** Note 2 provides significantly more detail about the second surgery, including specific techniques used to manage hemorrhage (bipolar coagulation, monopolar coagulation with bone wax). Note 1 is much more concise.\n*   **Anesthesia Type:** Note 1 specifies general anesthesia, while Note 2 describes a local anesthesia initial attempt.\n*   **Patient Age & Presentation:** Note 2 explicitly states the patient is a 23-year-old female, while Note 1 doesn't provide this information.\n*   **Specific Vascular Supply:** While both identify the same primary supplying arteries, Note 2 elaborates on the specific arteries (left temporalis superficial artery, left meningeal media artery, right temporalis superficialis artery) more explicitly.\n\n\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nDespite the differing initial treatment outcomes, the two notes describe the *same underlying condition* \u2013 an AVM in the left parietal region of the scalp. They represent two different cases of the same diagnosis, highlighting the variability in patient presentation, initial treatment approaches, and surgical techniques that can be employed.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any particular aspect of these notes, such as the different treatment techniques, or perhaps compare the potential reasons for the differing outcomes?"}}
