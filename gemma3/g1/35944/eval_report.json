Both notes describe the same underlying problem \u2013 a problematic mass posterior to the gallbladder \u2013 leading to a cholecystectomy and a successful, uncomplicated postoperative outcome.\n\n**I'd rate the similarity as approximately 85-90%.** The difference lies primarily in the depth of detail provided about the mass itself and the reasoning behind the specific surgical approach.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the comparison?"}}
