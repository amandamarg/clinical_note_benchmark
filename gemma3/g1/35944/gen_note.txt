**Subject:** Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Hemorrhagic Pedunculated Mass

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented to the Emergency Department today complaining of epigastric pain and nausea with bilious emesis, onset occurring suddenly a few hours prior.

**Examination Findings:** Patient reported symptoms consistent with epigastric pain and nausea. 

**Diagnostic Testing:**
*   Initial liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound were unremarkable.
*   Computed Tomography (CT) revealed a soft tissue mass located posterior to the gallbladder.
*   Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a complex cystic structure of indeterminate etiology, not communicating with biliary or vascular structures.

**Procedure:** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed for removal of a hemorrhagic pedunculated mass attached to the infundibulum of the gallbladder. The mass was easily dissected and resected using a harmonic scalpel. 

**Findings:** A considerable amount of inflammation was noted at the infundibulum of the gallbladder in proximity to the hemorrhagic mass. 

**Diagnosis:** Cholecystitis secondary to inflammation from the hemorrhagic mass.

**Postoperative Course:** Postoperative course was uneventful. Patient’s symptoms resolved immediately following surgery. Patient was discharged home on the first postoperative day and was asymptomatic at follow-up. 

**Plan:** Continued follow-up as scheduled.
