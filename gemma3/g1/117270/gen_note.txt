**Subject:** Right Arm Injury – Crush and Degloving Injury

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents today with a history of a crush and degloving injury to the right elbow, sustained while operating a waste agitator at an industrial waste management site.

**Examination Findings:**

On examination, the patient demonstrated significant findings related to the injury:

*   Massive skin and soft tissue defects were noted on the anterior aspect of the right elbow.
*   Exposure of the median nerve and brachial artery was observed, with contamination present.
*   Proximal loss of the entire extensor muscle group was identified.
*   Segmental loss of the radial nerve with a 6-cm gap was present.
*   Inability to extend the right wrist or fingers was noted.
*   Severe muscle weakness, graded 0 or 1 on manual muscle testing, was present in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves.
*   Signs of perfusion were observed in the distal right arm, but weaker than the contralateral arm.

**Intervention:**

The patient underwent multiple surgical interventions:

1.  Wound irrigation and debridement.
2.  Detection of a bacterial infection necessitating a return to the operating room.
3.  Saphenous vein bypass graft to reperfuse the occluded brachial artery.
4.  Placement of a muscle flap to close the open wound using the distal part of the extensor muscles, which were not salvageable due to the proximal muscle injury and the radial nerve defect.

**Post-Operative Course:**

The infection resolved following surgical intervention.

**Findings Post-Surgery:**

Muscle strengths improved to 2 or 3 on manual muscle testing, but there were no signs of recovery in the extensor muscles. Protective sensation was confirmed in the area innervated by the median and ulnar nerves. The ulnar collateral artery now perfuses distally due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft.

**Plan:**

Reconstruction of the finger extension with stabilization of the wrist is planned. The tendons of extensor carpi radialis and the tendon of abductor pollicis longus will be secured to the radius under 30° of dorsiflexion at the wrist and 10° of radial abduction of the thumb. 

The patient requires regular follow-up to monitor progress.
