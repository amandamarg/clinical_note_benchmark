**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Please Insert Patient Name Here*]
**Date:** [Date - *Please Insert Date Here*]
**Subject:** Retained Catheter and Laminectomy

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents for evaluation and treatment following a retained epidural catheter and subsequent laminectomy.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a history of right total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis.  The patient underwent surgery with epidural anesthesia.

**Significant Findings:**

During the removal of the epidural catheter, the catheter fractured 13 cm from the tip. Following the catheter fracture, imaging revealed the catheter fragment remained within the patient. An initial wait-and-see approach was employed due to the absence of neurological deficits.  Four weeks later, imaging demonstrated catheter migration. 

Subsequently, a decision was made to perform a surgical removal of the retained catheter. A laminectomy was performed at L2-3 under general anesthesia in the prone position.  During the procedure, the physician identified the spinal level and located the catheter utilizing an image intensifier. The L2 spinal process was exposed and split by an air drill, revealing the catheter coiled up at the surface of the dura mater, covered by a thin reactive film, and heading towards a nerve root. The bilateral flavum were removed in an unusual manner. 

**Post-Procedure:**  At the time of presentation, there were no reported neurological deficits.
