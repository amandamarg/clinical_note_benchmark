## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Orocutaneous Fistula – Left Mandible

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today with persistent complaints regarding an orocutaneous fistula located on the left side of the mouth floor adjacent to the left submandibular gland.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of a plasmacytoma that was removed from the medial side of the left mandible approximately 3 years ago.

**Clinical Findings:** CT imaging demonstrates a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous surgical interventions for this fistula have been unsuccessful, attributed to ineffective management of dead space surrounding the defect.

**Plan:** Patient will undergo surgical repair utilizing a submandibular gland pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps.

**Procedure:**
The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. It will involve:
*   Initial excision of the fistula.
*   Preparation of the healthy soft tissues.
*   Extension of the incision to the posterior and anterior directions following existing lines.
*   Dissection into the subplatysmal plane to access the base of the mandible.
*   Exposure of the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible.
*   Dissection of the surrounding soft tissues, preserving the arteriovenous supply and duct of the gland.
*   Mobilization of the gland.
*   Preparation of a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and the defect area.
*   Rotation of the submandibular gland through the tunnel, preserving the pedicle.
*   Stabilization of the gland with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures.
*   Closure of the cutaneous site with 5/0 polypropylene sutures.

**Follow-up:** Patient will receive detailed instructions regarding post-operative care and follow-up appointments.
