**Patient Name:** [Patient's Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** [Date of Note - To be filled in]
**Subject:** Post-Trauma Shoulder Injury

**History of Presenting Illness:**
Mr. [Patient's Name] presented to the clinic following a work accident involving a fall from a height of 2 meters, landing on his right side. He reports significant pain and swelling in his right shoulder and arm.

**Examination Findings:**
On examination, Mr. [Patient’s Name] exhibited a closed, neurovascular intact injury resulting in angulation of the right arm and loss of normal shoulder contour. Clinical examination revealed an anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a transverse fracture of the middle third of the humeral shaft.

**Intervention:**
Following the initial clinical survey, attempts at closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder were unsuccessful due to strong muscle contraction and extensive soft tissue swelling. Given the unstable state of the fractured humerus and the risk of further soft tissue compromise and iatrogenic neurovascular damage, reduction maneuvers were discontinued. The surgeons proceeded with stabilization of the humeral shaft fracture by intramedullary nailing. However, the procedure was interrupted following proximal locking screw insertion due to significant damage to the image intensifier equipment.

**Plan:**
Mr. [Patient’s Name] is currently being monitored closely. Further investigation, including potential secondary surgery, will be considered based on ongoing clinical assessment. We will continue to monitor for potential rotator cuff or biceps pathology.

**Prognosis:**
Prognosis is currently uncertain and will be continually reassessed.
