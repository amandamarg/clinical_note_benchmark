**Subject:** Chronic Periodontitis – Maxillary Right Quadrant

**History of Presenting Illness:** 
Patient presents today complaining of sharp pain in the upper right molar area that occurs specifically when biting on the right side of the mouth.

**Examination Findings:**
Clinical examination revealed localized severe chronic periodontitis affecting the maxillary right second premolar and the maxillary right first molar. The maxillary right second molar was found to be in a healthy condition. Scaling and root planning was performed one month prior to the autotransplantation. 

**Treatment Plan & Procedures:**
Due to the patient’s financial difficulty, an autotransplantation was deemed the best option. A periodontist was consulted, and a plan was established to transplant the maxillary right second molar to the maxillary right first molar space, followed by periodontal treatment. 

*   **Autotransplantation:** Under local anesthesia, the maxillary right first molar was extracted. The recipient site was prepared with a round bur and a duplicated tooth model. The maxillary right second molar was extracted and immediately placed into the recipient site and stabilized with 4-0 silk sutures and a semi-rigid resin wire splint. Extra-oral time from extraction of the maxillary right second molar to transplantation was 11 minutes.
*   **Root Canal Therapy:** Root canal therapy was initiated two weeks following the surgery. The calcium hydroxide dressing was maintained for two weeks, and root canal therapy was completed at four weeks post-surgery.
*   **Regenerative Periodontal Surgery:** At the 7-month follow-up, a regenerative periodontal surgery was performed on the maxillary right second premolar with a deep periodontal pocket. New bone formation was confirmed around the bifurcation area of the transplanted tooth. The autotransplanted tooth will be restored with a full crown.

**Medications:**
*   Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for one week.
*   Ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day for one week.
*   0.1% Chlorhexidine rinse for seven days. 

**Follow-up:** 
At the 18-month follow-up, the patient reported no clinical symptoms or radiographic signs of root resorption, and everything looked good. Patient instructed to continue good oral hygiene and return for regular checkups.
