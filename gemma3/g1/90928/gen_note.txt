**Subject:** Facial Dog Bite – Management and Follow-Up

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presents today for follow-up regarding a facial dog bite sustained 30 minutes prior to arrival. The patient reports multiple lacerations to the face, specifically involving the right zygoma, right paranasal area, right cheek, left eye lid, left paranasal area, left lower cheek, and over the left body of the mandible. 

**Initial Assessment (Emergency Department):** 

The patient initially presented to the Emergency Department following the dog bite. Emergency physicians examined the patient and noted no wounds elsewhere. However, due to the patient’s and their parents’ distress, a thorough intra-oral examination was not performed. They provided aqueous iodine solution for wound cleaning and initiated an oral course of Co-Amoxiclav and paracetamol. An ophthalmologist was consulted and reported no ocular injury.

**Subsequent Management:**

The patient was subsequently transferred to this unit for definitive management.  On admission, a surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia to achieve primary closure of the facial lacerations. During the procedure, an open fracture of the left mandible consistent with a dog bite was identified. This was treated via a trans-oral approach utilizing a five hole 1.2 mm titanium plate and four 3 mm screws. The facial laceration was copiously irrigated with normal saline and chlorhexidine and primarily closed in with a fine nylon suture. 

**Follow-up Examination (7 days post-op):**

At 7 days post-operative examination, the facial wounds were reported to be healing well, with no movement at the fracture site. 

**Final Management (10 weeks post-op):**

Ten weeks post-operative, the patient was admitted for removal of the mandibular plate under general anesthesia. The plate was removed with good bony union and no complications were noted. 

**Current Status & Plan:**

The patient will continue to be reviewed in clinic to monitor dentition.
