**HPI:**

Patient reports feeling tired today. Patient’s primary concern stems from a challenging period of caregiving for their mother who had end-stage breast cancer. Patient fulfilled the role of main caregiver, but acknowledged the difficulties associated with this role. 

**Background:** Patient reports a history of caring for their mother at home, utilizing home care services. The home care staff expressed concern regarding the lack of consistent family support and noted patient’s infrequent presence during visits. Patient attributed this to focusing on household chores, specifically dishwashing. Patient was unaware of their mother’s medication regimen and clothing organization. 

**Significant Findings:** 

During the appointment, it was revealed that the patient was diagnosed with Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ASD) in adulthood. Patient disclosed that they chose not to inform their parents about their diagnosis. The patient acknowledges the significant strain this situation placed on their ability to manage the home care schedule and household responsibilities, compounded by the stress caused by the home care staff’s distrust.

**Plan:** 

We will discuss the patient’s diagnosis of ASD with their family. We will develop a plan for ongoing support and address any concerns they may have.  We will schedule a follow-up appointment to review the plan and discuss further support options.
