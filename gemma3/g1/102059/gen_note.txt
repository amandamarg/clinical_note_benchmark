## Clinical Note

**Patient:** Mr. [Patient's Name]
**Date:** [Date of Note]
**Physician:** Dr. [Doctor's Name]

**Subject:** Spinal Compression Fracture & Metastatic Workup

**History of Presenting Illness:** Mr. [Patient’s Name] presented to the clinic for evaluation of sudden onset back pain with weakness in both legs and sensory change. He reports experiencing pain in the mid-thoracic area for the past 5 days, exacerbated by movement. He initially noted the weakness and sensory changes the day after the onset of pain.

**Examination Findings:** On examination, Mr. [Patient’s Name] exhibited grade IV motor power on both legs and hypoesthesia below the level of the xiphoid process. He was able to ambulate with the aid of a cane.

**Diagnostic Testing:** Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T8 acute compression fracture with cord compression. Laboratory tests, including tumor markers, were within normal limits. Chest and abdominal CT scans did not reveal any mass lesions in solid organs. A spinal embolization of the right T8 segmental artery was performed prior to surgery.

**Surgical Intervention:**  Mr. [Patient’s Name] underwent a total laminectomy of T8 and pedicle screw fixation from T6 to T10. During the procedure, tumors located at the ventral side of the dura sac were partially removed to achieve circumferential decompression of the spinal cord, and both T8 roots were resected. The operation was uneventful with no significant changes observed on neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring.

**Medications:** Anti-arrhythmic medications for one year. No other medications were noted.

**Plan:** The patient will continue to be monitored closely. Whole body positron emission tomography will be performed following confirmation of the pathologic diagnosis.
