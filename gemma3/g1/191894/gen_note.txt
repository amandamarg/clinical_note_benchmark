**Subject:** Evaluation of Wound Dehiscence and Hardware Exposure – Left Knee

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents to our department today for evaluation of wound dehiscence and hardware exposure involving the left knee. She reports persistent pain associated with the wound. 

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a significant history of total left hip arthroplasty performed at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain limiting her baseline activities. Eight years post-operative, she presented to orthopedics with progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly with ambulation, leading to difficulties in deambulation. X-ray examination revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. 

Following this, the patient underwent a revision total hip arthroplasty with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. Approximately three weeks post-revision, she developed symptoms suggestive of infection, including high fever, suppuration, and non-healing wound. Conservative management (intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainage) was unsuccessful, necessitating a staged replacement of the endoprosthesis femur. 

In the first stage, the previous prosthesis was removed with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity, and a cement spacer with antibiotic was placed. Two months later, the spacer was removed, and a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis was placed. 

**Current Presentation:**

The patient was subsequently referred to our unit four weeks after the last surgery for assessment of wound dehiscence to the left knee with hardware exposure. 

**Findings:**

The patient presented with wound dehiscence and hardware exposure on the left knee. Initial consideration was a lateral gastrocnemius flap for wound coverage, however, the surrounding area was severely scarred and the gastrocnemius muscle was atrophic, rendering it unsuitable. A free flap was ultimately chosen, but evidence of a lack of receptor vessels was noted, and the descending genicular artery was dissected, revealing small caliber and calcified plaques. 

**Plan:**

Retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap were performed. 

**Family Concerns:** 

The patient’s family expressed concern regarding her condition.
