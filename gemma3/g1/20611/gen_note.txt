## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Redacted for Privacy]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Assuming Today’s Date]
**Subject:** Final Clinical Note – Case of Sigmoid Colorectal Carcinoma

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presented to the Emergency Room with a chief complaint of constipation and unintentional weight loss.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reported a constellation of symptoms including constipation and weight loss that began approximately 3 months prior to presentation.

**Examination & Diagnostic Testing:**

Following initial evaluation, the patient underwent the following diagnostic testing:

*   **Abdominal Imaging:** Abdominal x-ray and CT scan revealed multiple air-fluid levels and a circumferential growth involving the sigmoid colon with impending perforation and small loculated collections reaching to the superior border of the urinary bladder and uterus extending to the lateral abdominal wall, suggestive of micro abscesses.
*   **Endoscopic Procedures:** Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, however, the colonoscopy was inconclusive due to narrowing proximal to the sigmoid colon.
*   **Surgical Intervention:**  Due to the concerning imaging, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and sigmoid colectomy. Findings during surgery included an exophytic sigmoid colon tumor proliferating extraluminally with small bowel adhesions. The tumor was adherent to the lateral pelvic abdominal wall with a subcutaneous abscess pocket. A tumor perforation in the sigmoid colon with minimal contamination was identified, and the tumor infiltrated the lateral wall of the uterus. No ascites, lymphadenopathy, or free peritoneal/omental deposits were noted.
*   **Pathology:** Histopathology revealed a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with a single sclerosed lymph node suggesting tumor metastasis and a foreign body giant cell reaction.
*   **Urogenital Evaluation:** Evaluation for a possible primary source of malignancy in the urogenital tract was conducted with the assistance of the gynecology and urology departments, but these investigations were negative, with no skin lesions or ulcers suggesting a primary cutaneous origin.
*   **Subsequent CT Scan:** A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen revealed a small fluid collection at the site of surgical anastomosis with few air pockets suggesting abscess formation/leakage, concomitant ascites, pleural effusion, and a liver lesion.

**Treatment:**  Initial management included regular wound dressings and later vacuum dressing application. Patient was transitioned to enteral nutrition and showed improvement in wound and overall health, leading to discharge for follow-up in 2 weeks.

**Final Outcome:**  I am deeply saddened to report the patient’s passing at their home. The final CT scan indicated complications related to the patient’s condition.

**[Family Member Inquiry Addressed]:**  Unfortunately, the patient’s medical condition ultimately proved fatal.
