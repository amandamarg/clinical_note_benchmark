**Subject:** Right Groin Pain & Hernia Repair

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presented with complaints of swelling and pain in the right groin, which began approximately 3 days prior.

**Examination & Findings:**

On examination, the swelling was noted to be approximately 10 x 10 cm. Vital signs were within normal limits. Blood tests were also normal. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a prolapse of the small intestine into the right groin, consistent with an indirect inguinal hernia. No apparent intestinal ischemia was identified. 

Following the CT findings, the patient was admitted for observation.  A Transabdominal Preperitoneal Repair (TAPP) was subsequently performed. 

During the TAPP, a coexistence of a femoral hernia and an indirect inguinal hernia was identified on the right side, along with an indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia on the left side. The repair included Exfoliation to include the thigh ring. The operation was performed in a supine position under general anesthesia utilizing three ports – two in the abdomen and one in the thigh. 

**Plan:**

Patient was discharged 3 days post-operatively after confirming no complications. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in a few weeks to assess recovery.
