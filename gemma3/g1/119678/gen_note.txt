**Subject:** Increased Water Intake & Abnormal Movements

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient presents for evaluation regarding increased water intake and two episodes of abnormal movements. Patient was referred by the medical department. 

**Subjective:**

Patient reports being referred for increased water intake and two episodes of abnormal movements.  These movements are described as sudden tightening of limbs and jaws with jerky movements, accompanied by urinary incontinence and loss of consciousness. The episodes began approximately one month prior to this visit. 

Patient reports a history of this issue dating back 2-3 years, following an episode of fever. Prior to this, he reported complaints of weakness and anxiety. He was advised to drink fluids and subsequently increased his daily water intake to approximately 10 liters per day. 

Current symptoms include intense thirst while talking or after urination, requiring water intake every five to ten minutes. The patient reports feeling anxious and irritable when unable to obtain water or when family members restrict water intake. He has a decreased appetite and has experienced a loss of weight over the past 2 years. He carries a 2-liter bottle with him at all times and has lost interest in work, citing weakness and fatigue as reasons for his absence. He denies any depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive thoughts, images, or impulses. 

**Objective:**

*   Low serum sodium levels noted during evaluation.
*   Jerky movements attributed to hyponatremia-induced seizure secondary to increased water intake.

**Assessment:**

Suspect psychogenic polydipsia. 

**Plan:**

Will order tests to confirm diagnosis and rule out other underlying medical conditions. Following test results, we will discuss treatment options and any follow-up requirements.
