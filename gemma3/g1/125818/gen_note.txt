**Patient Name:** Mrs. S.
**Date:** [Current Date - Insert Here]
**Subject:** IVF Pregnancy History & Delivery

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reports a complex pregnancy history following in vitro fertilization (IVF) for tubal factor infertility, initiated in January 2007.

**Past Medical History:** Patient underwent IVF in January 2007, resulting in a positive beta-hCG on January 20, 2007, and a confirmed twin pregnancy. Initially, one sac was placed low towards the cervical canal, and the other towards the fundus at 6 weeks gestation. An early ultrasound suggested a possible low implantation but did not confirm heterotopic pregnancy. Patient subsequently experienced bleeding pervaginum and was hospitalized for 3 days with conservative management. A repeat ultrasound at 7 weeks and 5 days confirmed an intrauterine and cervical heterotropic pregnancy.

**Hospitalization & Procedures:** Patient was readmitted on February 19, 2007, for fetal reduction of the cervical pregnancy. This was performed under general anesthesia with intrathoracic potassium chloride injection via transvaginal ultrasound guidance. Fetal cardiac activity was normal at the time of reduction. Patient was discharged after 2 days. The remainder of the pregnancy was uneventful, aside from mild vaginal spotting.

**Delivery:** At 28 weeks of gestation, the patient was readmitted with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Doppler studies revealed reduced umbilical blood flows with adequate liquor and normal middle cerebral artery blood flows. Serial monitoring with biweekly ultrasound for fetal Doppler studies was implemented. At 31 weeks of gestation, a lower segment cesarean section was performed due to absent end diastolic umbilical arterial fetal blood flow with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 5. A male baby weighing 1.16 kg was born on July 26, 2007. 

**Post-operative Findings:** Intraoperatively, the lower uterine segment showed presence of trophoblastic tissue, requiring hemostatic sutures near the isthmus and ballooning of the lower segment. Post-operative ultrasonography revealed small amounts of trophoblastic tissue with low vascularity.

**Note:** This information is based solely on the patient's report. Further investigation and confirmation are recommended.
