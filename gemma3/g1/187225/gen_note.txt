## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Please insert patient's name here*]
**Date:** [Date - *Please insert date here*]
**Subject:** Follow-up Appointment & Care Management

**HPI:** Patient reports feeling tired today. Patient has a significant history of caregiving for their mother who was diagnosed with end-stage breast cancer. 

**Significant History:** Patient reports a difficult experience as the primary caregiver, acknowledging the challenges associated with the role. Patient disclosed a diagnosis of Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ASD) which they had not previously shared with their parents. 

**Caregiving Experience:** Patient admits to struggling to maintain consistent involvement with home care visits due to focusing on household chores, specifically dishwashing. The home care staff expressed concern regarding the lack of family support and noted instances of patientâ€™s infrequent presence during visits, contributing to some distrust. 

**Mental Health:** Patient self-identified as having ASD, a diagnosis they had previously concealed from their family. This diagnosis likely contributed to difficulties with organization, attention, and potentially, communication. 

**Plan:** We will discuss the importance of disclosing the ASD diagnosis to family members to facilitate appropriate support. We will also establish a plan for follow-up care, focusing on strategies to manage the demands of caregiving and address the patient's diagnostic needs.  We will explore support options available for individuals with ASD. 

**Next Steps:** Family notification and scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss a comprehensive care plan.
