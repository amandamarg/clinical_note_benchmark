**Subject:** Thoracoscopic Removal of Foreign Body â€“ Right Hemithorax

**History of Presenting Illness:**

Patient presented this morning with a history of a right chest injury secondary to a metal splinter.

**Physical Exam Findings:**

On examination, the patient reported a history of a right chest injury. The abdomen was normal. No respiratory symptoms or signs were initially noted.

**Diagnostic Findings:**

*   X-ray revealed a foreign body in the right hemithorax.
*   CT scan confirmed the presence of a sharp foreign body in the right thoracic cavity, not close to major vessels. A minimal pneumothorax was identified, but not clinically evident.

**Procedure:**

The patient underwent thoracoscopic removal of the foreign body. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with intubation via double lumen tube and placement in the anterolateral right thoracotomy position. Single lung ventilation with CO2 insufflation (up to 5mm Hg) was utilized for safer trocar placement and improved visualization. A 10mm camera port was placed in the right 5th intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. A 5mm working port was placed in the same intercostal space. The foreign body was located on the inferior surface of the lung and removed. The rest of the thoracic cavity and diaphragm were found to be normal. An intercostal tube was placed in the 10mm port site.

**Postoperative Course:**

The procedure was uncomplicated. The patient recovered well from anesthesia with a well-expanded lung, confirmed clinically and with a bedside X-ray. The patient required elective ventilation for 18 hours. The patient was extubated and the ICD was removed the same day and discharged on the second postoperative day.

**Plan:**

Follow-up appointments will be scheduled.
