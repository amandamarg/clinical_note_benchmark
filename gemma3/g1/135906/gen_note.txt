**Subject:** Recurrent Thigh Swelling – Mazabraud’s Syndrome

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today reporting recurrent swelling in the left thigh.  The initial swelling was noted in 2001 and has progressively increased in size.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a history of recurrent thigh swelling, with two prior surgeries for its removal in 2005 and 2009.

**Current Findings:** Patient reports a new swelling over the left distal thigh, currently measuring approximately 8 cm x 4 cm, located on the medial aspect of the thigh. The swelling is painless and associated with quadriceps wasting. 

**Relevant History:** Patient reports being asymptomatic for 2 years following the first surgery and 3 years following the second surgery. 

**Diagnostic Findings:**

*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the entire thigh revealed two additional soft tissue masses in the left mid-thigh and inguinal region.
*   Biopsy report of the excised distal thigh swelling was suggestive of myxoma.

**Clinical Diagnosis:** Mazabraud’s Syndrome

**Management:** Patient elected to undergo wide excision of the large distal thigh swelling through the previously existing skin incision.

**Procedure Details:** Wide excision of the distal thigh swelling was performed, resulting in the removal of a single, globular, pale white, encapsulated nodular mass measuring 8 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm, weighing approximately 88 g. The mass was located within the vastus medialis.  Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intramuscular myxoma with no necrotic areas or atypical features.
