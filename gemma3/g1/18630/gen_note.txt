**Subject:** Postpartum Bleeding - Complex Case

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents today reporting persistent, heavy postpartum bleeding. The bleeding began approximately 6 days after delivery of her third child (second delivery) via spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 3500 grams. 

**Past Medical History:** 

The patient reports no prior medical problems during her pregnancy or follow-up visits. She has had three pregnancies, two resulting in live births.

**Course of Events:**

Initially, the patient experienced heavy bleeding following delivery that was unresponsive to medical therapies, ultimately necessitating a hysterectomy. Following the hysterectomy, the patient experienced recurrent bleeding, requiring a cuff repair. Subsequently, further bleeding prompted another intervention â€“ hypogastric artery ligation. Despite this, bleeding persisted, leading to her referral to this clinic. 

**Clinical Examination & Diagnostic Findings:**

*   **Initial Examination:** Upon arrival, hemodynamics were stable and lab parameters were normal.
*   **Ultrasonography:** Demonstrated normal ovaries and no fluid in the abdominal cavity.
*   **Vaginal Examination:** Revealed no bleeding.
*   **Lab Results:** Hemoglobin level at presentation was 4.8 g/dL.
*   **CT Scan:** CT with contrast enhancement revealed findings suggestive of an aneurysmal filling in the pelvic area.
*   **Angiography:** Interventional radiology performed angiography, closing the arteriovenous fistula and obstructing the right internal iliac artery.

**Intervention & Outcome:** 

Emergency surgery was performed with no active bleeding focus detected. 

**Current Status:** 

Patient reports intermittent bleeding following partial intraoperative ligation.
