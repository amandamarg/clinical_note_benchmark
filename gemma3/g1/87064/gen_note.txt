**Subject:** Patient Presents with Illness Anxiety Disorder – Referral to Psychiatry

**History:**

Patient presented today expressing significant concerns regarding a suspected cancer diagnosis and a limited life expectancy. Patient reported experiencing persistent symptoms including fatigue, weakness, and unintentional weight loss over the past six months. Patient has been frequenting the primary health care center with variable symptoms and inconclusive diagnoses.

**Examination & Investigations:**

Initial physical examination and investigations, including radiological and pathological assessments, were performed to rule out cancer. All investigations returned negative results.

**Assessment:**

Based on the patient’s persistent preoccupation with a serious illness, despite negative test results, and the debilitating impact on their daily life, the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder (previously known as Neurotic Disorder with Anxiety). 

**Plan:**

The patient has been referred to the Psychiatry Department for a comprehensive psychological and social evaluation. The hospital administration has reported this case to the Department of Medical Eligibility due to the patient’s frequent visits and the lack of a definitive diagnosis.  A scheduled appointment with the psychiatrist will include a full psychological and social evaluation.
