Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key similarities:\n\n**1. Patient Presentation:**\n\n*   **Chief Complaint:** Both describe a patient presenting with sudden onset weakness and facial droop (deviation of angle of mouth to the left).\n*   **Initial Symptoms:** Both highlight the sudden onset of symptoms, the specific weakness, and the facial droop.\n*   **Negative History:** Both patients deny headache, vomiting, seizures, stroke, or TIA history. They also deny cardiac issues, diabetes, or hypertension.\n\n**2. Physical Examination Findings:**\n\n*   **Vital Signs:**  Both note a pulse rate of 180 bpm (Text 1) and 180/min (Text 2) along with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg.\n*   **Neurological Exam:** Both document right upper motor neuron facial nerve palsy, muscle power of 3/5 in upper limbs and 2/5 in lower limbs with a right extensor plantar response.\n\n**3. Investigations & Findings:**\n\n*   **CT Brain:** Both reveal a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct measuring 2 x 3 cm.\n*   **ECG:** Both show a regular narrow QRS complex long RP tachycardia at a rate of 186 bpm with inverted p waves in lead III.\n*   **Other Investigations:** Both report normal liver and renal function tests, normal serum calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels, and normal serum troponin T and creatine phosphokinase levels.\n\n**4. Treatment & Management:**\n\n*   **Adenosine:** Both patients experience a transient complete atrioventricular block with intravenous adenosine, resolving within one minute.\n*   **Verapamil:** Both initiate verapamil with subsequent development of sinus bradycardia leading to its immediate withholding.\n*   **Final Diagnosis:** Both conclude with a diagnosis of Atrial Tachycardia.\n\n**5. Outcome:**\n\n*   The final notes both report the patient's recovery over one week with a normal ECG and a rate of 64 bpm, and then 68 bpm at the follow-up.\n\n**In conclusion, the two notes describe the same clinical scenario with minor variations in wording and the specific numerical values of some observations.  They are essentially two accounts of the same patient\u2019s presentation, investigations, and management.**"}}
