This is the core of the issue.\n*   **Calf Muscle Swelling Description:**  The exact description of the calf muscle swelling \u2013 bilateral, painless, swollen, approximately 10cm x 3cm on the right and 3cm x 3cm on the left \u2013 is identical in both notes.\n*   **Physical Exam Findings:** The physical examination findings are nearly identical. Both notes detail:\n    *   Palpable medial tenderness with movement in the right knee.\n    *   Limited full knee flexion in the right knee.\n    *   Normal neurological exam (full strength, normal reflexes).\n    *   Normal skin appearance (no deformities, erythema, warmth, intact arterial pulsations).\n*   **MRI Findings:** Both MRI reports reveal bilateral multiple saccular intramuscular venous malformations involving the soleus muscle.\n*   **Management Plan:**  Both notes conclude with a conservative management plan agreed upon in consultation with a vascular surgeon due to the asymptomatic presentation of the venous malformations and the potential for muscle damage from resection. A three-month follow-up is scheduled.\n*   **X-Ray Results:** Both X-rays show no bony irregularities in the tibia.\n\n**Minor Differences:**\n\n*   **Patient Age & Specifics:** Text 2 specifies the patient is 75 years old, while Text 1 does not.\n*   **Initial Treatment:** Text 2 details the initial treatment initiated \u2013 steroid infiltration with lidocaine and depomedrol. Text 1 does not mention any initial treatment.\n*   **Slightly Different Measurement phrasing:** One uses \"approximately\" while the other uses \"about\".\n*   **Figure Reference:** Text 2 references a figure in the medical record. Text 1 does not.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThese two notes describe essentially the *same* clinical presentation and diagnostic findings. They represent two independent cases of the same underlying condition \u2013 bilateral intramuscular venous malformations of the soleus muscle \u2013 presenting with knee pain and calf swelling. The differences are primarily related to specific details about the patient\u2019s age, initial treatment, and the inclusion of a visual reference (Figure) in Text 2.\n\n**In conclusion, the notes are remarkably similar \u2013 approximately 90-95% overlap in content.**"}}
