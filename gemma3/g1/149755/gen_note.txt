**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Post-Traumatic Fracture Management – Left Tibia & Fibula

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented immediately following a road traffic accident involving crush injury to the left leg. 

**Examination Findings:**

The patient reported significant pain at the time of injury. Examination revealed a grade IIIb compound fracture of the left tibia, distal third, with a 20cm x 8cm wound over the anteromedial side of the lower third of the tibia extending to the medial side of the ankle joint and foot. Periosteum exposure was noted in the lower third of the tibia. The wound was severely contaminated and the fibula was found to be at the same level as the tibia with a short oblique fracture.

**Interventions:**

*   Immediate debridement performed within 2 hours of injury, including thorough wash and debridement of dead and devitalized tissue.
*   Biplanar external fixator applied.
*   Regular wound dressing provided.
*   Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics administered.
*   Two further debridements performed.
*   At 4 weeks, a cross-leg flap was performed due to wound healing.
*   External fixator removed at 3.5 weeks post-flap due to multiple pin track infections. Limb immobilized in a long leg cast.
*   Posterior bone grafting with bridge fibula grafting was performed at 3.5 months post-injury with cancellous graft from the right iliac crest.

**Radiological Findings:**

*   Initial radiographs showed a distal third tibia fracture with a segmental piece of tibia which was further comminuted.
*   At 3.5 months post-injury, radiographs demonstrated a good union response at the proximal end of the tibia fracture, however, the distal end appeared rounded with attempt to callus formation which is non-bridging.
*   Abnormal mobility at the fracture site precluded internal fixation. The fibula fracture was completely united.

**Plan:**

Continued monitoring of patient’s progress with follow-up appointments as needed.
