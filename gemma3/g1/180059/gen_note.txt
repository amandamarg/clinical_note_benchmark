## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Note: Patient name not provided in dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Note: Date not provided in dialogue*]
**Subject:** Follow-up for Lung and Vertebral Lesions

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presented for a routine checkup. During the examination, a small nodule was identified in the right lung and a lytic lesion was discovered in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.

**Physical Examination:** Initial examination revealed no other significant findings. Subsequent imaging studies (CT and MR) continued to demonstrate the pulmonary nodule and vertebral lesion.

**Investigations:**

*   **Initial Imaging:** CT scan revealed a small nodule in the right lung and a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone. Laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative.
*   **Biopsy:** Biopsy samples of both the pulmonary nodule and the lytic lesion were obtained, however, they were insufficient for definitive diagnosis.
*   **Subsequent Imaging (5 Years Later):** CT scan demonstrated a slight increase in size of the pulmonary nodule and an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.


**Findings:**

*   Pulmonary nodule in the right lung, initially identified and subsequently demonstrated slight growth.
*   Lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone, initially identified and subsequently demonstrated growth.
*   During video-assisted thoracic surgery and curettage, the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was found to be located on the posterior surface of the vertebra and was contained within the bone, with no extension into the spinal canal.

**Diagnosis:** Suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.

**Clinical Course:** Patient made good postoperative progress and remained free of disease at 41 months following surgical intervention. No significant findings beyond the persistent pulmonary and vertebral lesions were noted through continued imaging examinations.

**Plan:** Continued observation and monitoring.

**Sincerely,**
