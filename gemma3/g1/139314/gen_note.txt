**Subjective:**

Patient presents today for follow-up regarding a persistent dermatological issue. Patient reports initial onset of vesicular eruptions on the left side of the face approximately 5 days prior to presentation. The eruptions are vesicular in nature and associated with a burning sensation. Patient also reports similar eruptions on the left side of the mid-palatine suture, involving both the hard and soft palate. The patient describes the pain as a continuous stabbing and burning type of pain with periods of exacerbations and remissions, exacerbated by light touch of clothing in the left middle half of the face, extending from the ala of the nose to the lower canthus of the eye and laterally up to the malar region.

**Objective:**

*   **Physical Exam:** Examination reveals vesicular eruptions on the left side of the face, localized to the left half of the face, not crossing the midline. The eruptions range in size from 0.5 cm to 4 mm.  Vesicles are also noted on the left side of the mid-palatine suture involving the hard and soft palate.
*   **Pain Assessment:** Patient continues to report significant pain.

**Assessment:**

Diagnosis of herpes zoster involving the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve was established.

**Plan:**

Initially, the patient was prescribed Acyclovir 800 mg five times a day for 7 days and Tramadol 50 mg twice a day. Following a significant improvement in symptoms, a new treatment approach was implemented consisting of bi-weekly Streptomycin sulfate injections mixed with 2% lidocaine for the first 6 weeks, followed by alternate week injections for the next 4 weeks. 

**Note:** Patient ultimately succumbed to complications. Expressed gratitude for care provided.
