## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name – To be completed]
**Date:** [Date of Note – To be completed]
**Subject:** Orocutaneous Fistula – Surgical Plan

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today with a persistent orocutaneous fistula. 

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of a plasmacytoma removed from the medial side of the left mandible three years ago. 

**Referral:** Patient was referred to our clinic for management of this orocutaneous fistula.

**Examination Findings:** CT imaging demonstrates a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible, neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous surgical interventions have been unsuccessful in closing the fistula, primarily due to ineffective management of dead space surrounding the fistula.

**Proposed Surgical Plan:** 

We will proceed with a surgical intervention utilizing a submandibular gland pedicled flap to address the defect. The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. 

**Procedure Details:**

1.  Initial excision of the fistula with preparation of the healthy soft tissues.
2.  Extension of the extraoral incision to the posterior and anterior directions following previous incision lines.
3.  Dissection in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible.
4.  Dissection of the neck fascia exposing the submandibular gland and base of the mandible.
5.  Careful dissection of the surrounding soft tissues, preserving the arteriovenous supply and duct of the submandibular gland.
6.  Mobilization of the gland.
7.  Preparation of a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and the defect area.
8.  Rotation of the submandibular gland through the soft tissue tunnel, preserving the pedicle.
9.  Suture of the rotated gland to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization.
10. Closure of the cutaneous site with 5/0 polypropylene sutures (mattress sutures).

**Follow-up:** Patient will receive post-operative instructions and a schedule for follow-up appointments.
