**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Not Provided in Dialogue]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Not Provided in Dialogue]
**Subject:** Fetal Echocardiography Follow-Up

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presented for follow-up regarding a referral for fetal echocardiography due to concerns regarding abnormally looking great arterial arches. The patient is gravid 2, para 1-0-0-1.

**Examination Findings:**

Fetal echocardiography revealed the normal four-chamber view, with two atria and two ventricles of normal size and thickness. The atrioventricular valves moved normally. Two great arteries arose normally from the appropriate ventricles. The pulmonary and aortic valves appeared normal, and the size of the main pulmonary artery and aortic root were within normal limits. 

However, the aortic arch was normal in size and location, but the ductal arch was not visualized in any views. Color Doppler examination revealed a tortuous ‘S’ shaped ductus dexterous arteriosus (DA) visualized inside the aortic arch. The DA joined the descending aorta with an obtuse angle and showed a flow signal from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. Color aliasing occurred along the course of the ductus, but pulsed Doppler measurement of velocity was not attempted due to the poor angle of insonation. Flow velocity and waveforms of the two great arteries were within normal limits and no tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was found. 

**Previous Examination (27 Weeks):**

A repeat examination performed at 27 weeks of gestation showed nearly the same findings as the initial examination. The right ventricle (RV) was normal in size and thickness and no TR was noted. 

**Diagnosis:**

S-shaped DA with mild narrowing.

**Plan:**

Continued monitoring of pregnancy with scheduled follow-up examinations.
