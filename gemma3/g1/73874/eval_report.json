They subsequently received a cranial prosthesis to reconstruct the defect.\n*   **Key Procedures:** Both detail the core steps:\n    *   Craniotomy\n    *   Placement of a cranial prosthesis\n    *   Post-operative physical therapy\n    *   Return to school\n*   **Details on Prosthesis:** Both texts provide specific details about the prosthesis:\n    *   Size (12 cm x 12 cm vs. 20cm x 12cm)\n    *   Thickness (5 mm vs. 6mm)\n    *   Material (PMMA)\n    *   Printing process (using a 3D printer)\n    *   Finishing and sterilization.\n\n**Differences:**\n\n*   **Number of Patients:** Text 1 describes a single patient, while Text 2 describes *two* separate patients.\n*   **Patient Details:** Text 1 provides very minimal patient details (just \u201cPatient Name\u201d and \u201cDate\u201d). Text 2 gives more specific information, including the patient\u2019s age (10 and 17 years old) and a brief description of how the second patient\u2019s injury occurred (motorcycle accident).\n*   **Specific Measurements:** While both mention dimensions, Text 2 provides more specific measurements.\n*   **Detailed Process Descriptions:** Text 2 offers significantly more granular detail about the entire process, including:\n    *   The software used for designing the prosthesis (ZBrush 4R5\u00ae)\n    *   The 3D printer model (CUBE 3D)\n    *   The filament used (PLA 1,75mm)\n    *   The sterilization method (ethylene oxide gas)\n    *   The monitoring period (6 months)\n*   **Context and Background:** Text 2 includes a far greater amount of technical and contextual information, such as details about DICOM image storage, the purpose of the bone filter, and the cost of materials. It delves into the rationale behind these choices (e.g., the reason for the 6-month monitoring period).\n\n**Overall Similarity Level:**\n\nI'd estimate that the two texts share approximately **60-70%** similarity. They are fundamentally describing the same medical procedure but differ significantly in the depth of detail and the number of patients they address.\n\nDo you want me to focus on a particular aspect of the comparison, such as the technical details or the differences in patient descriptions?"}}
