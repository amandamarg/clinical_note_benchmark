**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name – *To be filled in*]
**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Assuming today’s date)
**Subject:** Right Patellar Dislocation

**History of Present Illness:** 
The patient presents to the Emergency Department today complaining of acute pain in the right knee, sustained during dancing (quick-step). Patient reports the pain occurred last night while rotating a planted right foot. Patient initially noted a locked, full extension of the right leg with severe pain and a palpable patellar displacement laterally.

**Past Medical History:** 
Patient denies any prior history of knee trauma or dislocations. Patient also denies any joint hypermobility or paediatric lower limb alignment problems.

**Physical Examination:** 
On examination, there was a significant deformity of the right patella, demonstrating rotation on its vertical axis with tenting of the skin over the knee joint. The joint was fixed in position with a mild joint effusion noted. Range of motion was significantly reduced with any flexion from full extension, causing pain. The straight leg raise was performed and found to be intact, indicating an intact extensor mechanism. The contralateral limb was normal. 

**Diagnostic Findings:** 
An AP radiograph revealed a laterally dislocated patella with an abnormal appearance, including the patella impacted in the intercondylar notch of the femur. 

**Treatment:** 
One unsuccessful attempt at closed reduction under procedural sedation with propofol and fentanyl was performed. Following this, the patella was successfully relocated using a general anesthetic with a muscle relaxant via closed reduction. 

**Plan:** 
Patient to rest the right knee for a few days and take prescribed pain medication. Follow-up appointment scheduled in one week for checkup.
