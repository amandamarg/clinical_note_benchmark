**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** [Date of Note - To be filled in]
**Subject:** Lumbar Mass Evaluation & Surgical Plan

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presents with a mass on the back that has been bothering them for approximately one year.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reports a mass located just below the right scapular line, near the ribs, which has been producing a dull pain recently. The mass has not changed in size over the past year.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. No prior history of back trauma or surgery.

**Physical Examination:** 
On examination, a palpable mass was identified approximately 5 cm in diameter, several centimeters below the point indicated, located in the lumbar region. The mass was described as soft and mobile with a smooth border and was not reducible. Palpation did not elicit tenderness. The examination was otherwise unremarkable.

**Assessment:** Based on physical findings and the patient’s history, a diagnosis of lipoma is suspected.

**Plan:** Excision of the suspected lipoma is indicated due to the patient’s discomfort and the potential for a minimally invasive approach. Preoperative examination, including placement on the left side with legs flexed, will be performed to identify and mark the mass. 

**Next Steps:** Preoperative examination scheduled.
