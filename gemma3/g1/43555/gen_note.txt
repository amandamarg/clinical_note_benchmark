**Patient Name:** [Patient Name - Not Provided]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Not Provided]

**Subject:** Follow-up and Final Clinical Note

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presented today with a longstanding mass in the posterior thigh, noted over the past year. Initial evaluation revealed varicosities on the surface of the mass. The patient initially received a diagnosis of a venous blood clot and was treated with warfarin for six months by his primary care physician. Subsequent imaging, including a PET/CT two years prior, interpreted a hypermetabolic area in the biceps femoris muscle as a muscle injury.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a history of Stage II Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), diagnosed 11 years ago. He underwent a left nephrectomy following the diagnosis. He also experienced metastasis six years ago to the pancreas and spleen, which were resected via a total resection.

**Physical Examination:**

On examination today, a large, painless, tense mass was palpated along the length of the biceps femoris muscle in the posterior aspect of the left thigh, measuring greater than 25 cm. Varicosities were noted on the surface of the mass.

**Diagnostic Studies:**

*   **PET/CT:** Demonstrated hypermetabolic activity with an uptake value of 3.8 to 4.1 in the biceps femoris muscle, with multiple serpiginous vessels throughout the tumor, raising the possibility of a large cavernous hemangioma or angiosarcoma.
*   **MRI:** Revealed a mesenchymal component within an encapsulated mass, increasing the suspicion for a liposarcoma or angiosarcoma.
*   **Core Tissue Biopsy:** Demonstrated well-defined adipose tissue.
*   **Pre-Embolization & Surgical Resection:** Following the biopsy results and high suspicion for malignancy, the patient underwent pre-embolization followed by surgical resection of the mass.

**Final Diagnosis:**

The resected mass was determined to be a metastasis from his primary RCC.

**Clinical Course & Outcome:**

Despite treatment, the mass was determined to be too advanced, ultimately leading to the patientâ€™s death.
