**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Chronic Abdominal Wound & Subphrenic Collection

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents with a discharging wound in the upper abdomen, noted approximately one month ago. The patient reports a history of an emergency exploratory laparotomy six months prior for a small peptic perforation, repaired with an omental patch. Following the initial surgery, a burst abdomen occurred on the fourth post-operative day, managed conservatively. Despite subsequent bowel recovery and oral nutrition, the initial abdominal wound failed to heal.

**Physical Examination:**
On examination, a 12 cm x 5 cm elliptical skin graft was noted over the mid-abdomen.  An approximately 1 cm x 1 cm depressed ulcer was present at the upper border of the graft, covered with pale granulation tissue and exhibiting serous oozing. Several areas of exuberant pale granulation tissue were also observed. Palpation revealed a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.

**Relevant Past Medical History:**
* Emergency exploratory laparotomy six months prior for peptic perforation, repaired with an omental patch.

**Laboratory Findings:**
* Hemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl
* Total WBC Count: 11.6 x 103/mm3
* Total Serum Protein: 7.9 gm/dl
* Serum Albumin: 3.5 gm/dl

**Imaging:**
* Ultrasound: Left subphrenic collection, 8 cm x 7 cm.

**Assessment:** Chronic abdominal wound with evidence of a persistent ulcer, deficient abdominal wall, and a subphrenic collection.  Suspicion of missed pathology from previous surgery.

**Plan:**
1.  Schedule follow-up appointment.
2.  Order CT scan to further evaluate the area and determine the cause of the current problem.
3.  Consultation with a wound care specialist may be warranted.
4.  Family will be kept informed of progress.
