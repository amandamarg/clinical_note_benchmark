**Subjective:**

Patient reports experiencing sharp, left-sided chest pain for the past few days, which began last night and worsened throughout the night. The pain is exacerbated by stress. Pain radiates to the left shoulder. Patient reports a history of similar, mild left-sided chest pains for the past few months, typically occurring with stress or exertion, which were transient and resolved spontaneously. Patient admits to a 5-pack-year smoking history, quit 10 years ago. Patient reports occasional alcohol consumption. Patient denies taking any pain medications for prior symptoms.

**Objective:**

*   **Vitals:** Blood pressure 165/81 mmHg at presentation.
*   **Cardiac Examination:** Normal cardiac examination findings.
*   **Laboratory Results:** Elevated lipid profile with a cholesterol level of 238 mg/dl. Serial troponin-I was normal.
*   **ECG:** Showed premature supraventricular complexes, no ischemic changes.
*   **Telemetry:** Patient experienced runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia while admitted to the telemetry unit.

**Assessment:**

Patient presents with chest pain, likely related to underlying cardiac issues given the history of arrhythmias and elevated lipids.  Findings suggest possible underlying ischemic heart disease, despite normal troponin levels.

**Plan:**

Patient will continue to be monitored on the telemetry unit.  Cardiac exercise stress test and echocardiogram performed, revealing a normal ejection fraction but a dilated left atrium and apical wall motion abnormality. Cardiac catheterization showed no coronary obstruction.  Further monitoring is warranted to assess for continued arrhythmias and ensure stability.  Patient will be followed closely.
