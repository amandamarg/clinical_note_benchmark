## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Post-Motor Vehicle Accident – Thoracostomy, Clavicle Fracture, Femur Fracture

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents following a motor vehicle accident in which he lost control of his vehicle and struck a house. Patient reports significant pain in his chest and leg.

**Physical Examination:**

*   **Respiratory:** Decreased breath sound over the right hemithorax, increased respiratory rate. Patient reports shortness of breath.
*   **Musculoskeletal:** Crepitus noted over the right clavicle and deformity in the right thigh.
*   **Neurological/Vascular:** Normal neurologic and vascular examinations of the extremities.

**Diagnostic Findings:**

*   **Radiographic Analysis:** Chest X-ray reveals a right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement and a partial pneumothorax. CT imaging confirms the clavicle fracture penetrated the pleural cavity and caused the lung collapse.
*   **Glasgow Coma Scale:** 15 (as per report)

**Treatment:**

*   Thoracostomy tube inserted into the right pleural cavity and placed under suction to inflate the lung.
*   Patient placed in a sling for clavicle fracture support.
*   Two days post-injury, underwent open reduction with internal fixation (intramedullary nailing with centromedullary device) for displaced femoral shaft fracture without complication.

**Assessment:** 

Right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement and partial pneumothorax. Displaced femoral shaft fracture treated with intramedullary nailing.

**Discussion:** Due to the magnitude of the clavicle fracture displacement and associated partial pneumothorax, nonoperative treatment is unlikely to achieve union. Surgical intervention (open reduction) was discussed in relation to orthopedic and cardiopulmonary risks.

**Plan:** Continued monitoring of patient’s condition.
