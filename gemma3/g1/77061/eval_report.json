Note 1 simply states the patient was started on flucloxacillin.\n*   **Investigation Results Specifics:** Note 2 provides the specific Doppler scan findings (near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins), whereas note 1 just states \u201cDemonstrated near complete occlusion\u2026\u201d.\n*   **Emphasis on potential trigger:** Note 2 highlights the potential role of the collar and cuff in triggering the thrombosis.\n\n**Overall Similarity Assessment:**\n\nThe notes are *extremely* similar. They describe the *same* clinical case.  The differences are minor, mostly related to the level of detail provided in the investigations and treatment decisions.  You could argue that they are essentially two variations of the *same* clinical note.\n\n**In conclusion, the similarity is very high \u2013 around 95%.**\n\nDo you want me to delve deeper into any specific aspect of the similarities or differences?"}}
