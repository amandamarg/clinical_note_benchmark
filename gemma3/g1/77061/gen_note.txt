**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. [Patient's Name]
**Date:** [Date of Note]
**Subject:** Left Shoulder Fracture and Subsequent Venous Thrombosis

**History:**

Mrs. [Patient’s Name] presented to the Accident and Emergency Department following a fall, presenting with pain and reduced range of movement in her left shoulder. 

**Past Medical History:**

*   Hypertension
*   Atrial Fibrillation (on 75mg aspirin once daily)
*   Thyroidectomy (2000) for hyperthyroidism.
*   No known drug allergies.

**Examination:**

Initial examination revealed a bruised and painful left shoulder with attempted movements. Distal neurovascular status of the left arm was normal with no deficit detected. Plain film radiographs of the left shoulder demonstrated a minimally displaced and impacted fracture of the proximal humerus.

Following presentation to the A&E department, a swelling and erythema on the left side of her neck in the distribution of the external jugular vein was noted. The collar and cuff had been applied rather tightly. 

**Investigations:**

*   Plain film radiographs: Proximal humerus fracture (minimally displaced and impacted).
*   Doppler scan: Demonstrated near complete occlusion of the left subclavian and axillary veins, consistent with a deep vein thrombosis.

**Management:**

Following review by the ENT registrar, a diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein was made, with the erythema potentially developing cellulitis. The patient was started on flucloxacillin 500mg four times daily for 5 days, and placed in a better fitting sling. The fracture was deemed suitable for non-surgical management with regular clinical and radiological follow-up. 

**Current Status:**

Two days later, the patient re-presented to A&E with pain and gross pitting oedema in her left arm. 

**Plan:**

The patient will be seen for follow-up in approximately three weeks. Continued clinical and radiological follow-up will be arranged.
