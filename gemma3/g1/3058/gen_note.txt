**Subject:** Follow-up regarding pulmonary nodule and vertebral lesion.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reports a history of a small nodule discovered during a routine medical checkup. Subsequent investigations revealed a lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone and a small nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung.

**Exam Findings:** Initial physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory studies were within normal limits or negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed the lytic lesion separated from the spinal canal and the pulmonary nodule. 

**Diagnostic Procedures:**
*   Biopsy specimens were obtained from both the pulmonary nodule and the vertebral lesion.
*   Biopsy results showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance, but definitive diagnosis could not be made due to the small size of the samples.
*   The patient was placed under close observation with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.

**Follow-up:**
*   Five years later, a CT scan indicated a slight increase in the size of the pulmonary nodule.
*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
*   Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed for the pulmonary lesion and curettage of the lytic bone lesion.
*   Clinical course post-operatively was good with the patient remaining disease-free 41 months after the operation.

**Current Status:** Patient reports good postoperative progress and remains free of disease.

**Plan:** Continued close observation. 

**Physician:** Dr. Smith
