The ultrasound and MRI confirm the presence of hematomas within the rectus femoris muscles.\n*   **Measurements:** Both notes meticulously document the range of motion (ROM) \u2013 specifically, a right knee ROM of 40\u00b0 and a left knee ROM of 55\u00b0 (active) and the same limitations due to pain (passive).\n*   **Diagnostic Findings:** Both confirm the negative results of the initial X-ray, the presence of hematomas, and the classification of the strain as a second-grade or moderate muscle strain.\n*   **Treatment Plan:** The initial treatment plans are remarkably similar: rest, ice, elevation, and pain medication.\n*   **Follow-up:** Both notes include a re-evaluation in one week and a coagulation profile examination.\n\n**Differences (Lower \u2013 Approximately 10-15%)**\n\n*   **Patient Demographics:** One is a 21-year-old Greek Caucasian female rowing athlete, while the other is a generalized description.\n*   **Detailed Treatment:** Text 2 provides a *much* more detailed account of the treatment protocol, including specifics like muscle relaxant drugs, NSAIDs, isometric exercises, and a phased return to activity. Text 1's plan is much more basic.\n*   **Specific Actions Taken:** Text 2 details the use of compression dressings, ice packs, and active stretching. Text 1 simply mentions \"rest\" and \"pain medication.\"\n*   **Timeline of Recovery:** Text 2 offers a far more granular timeline of the recovery process (e.g., the 48-hour initial treatment, the progression to stretching and strengthening, the return to walking, the full return to sport after six weeks). Text 1's follow-up is much more brief.\n*   **Additional Diagnostic Tests:** Text 2 includes a more comprehensive examination to rule out compartment syndrome and mentions a family history check.\n*   **Specific Imaging Details:** While both use MRI, Text 2 provides more context around the imaging process (e.g., \"Figure, Figure, Figure\").\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThese two notes are incredibly similar, representing essentially the same clinical scenario. The core diagnosis, mechanism of injury, and initial treatment approaches are identical. The primary difference lies in the level of detail provided in Text 2, offering a more complete picture of the patient's recovery journey.\n\nDo you want me to focus on a specific aspect of the comparison (e.g., the differences in treatment, or the diagnostic findings)?"}}
