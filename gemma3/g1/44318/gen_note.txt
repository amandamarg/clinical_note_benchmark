**Subject:** Abdominal Mass & Diagnostic Findings

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today reporting a 5-month history of a dull aching pain in the left side of the abdomen and the presence of a gradually enlarging abdominal mass. Patient reports occasional vomiting.

**Examination Findings:** 
Upon examination, the patientâ€™s left upper quadrant revealed a large, palpable abdominal mass. 

**Diagnostic Imaging & Procedures:**
*   **Ultrasonography of the abdomen** revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass occupying the whole abdomen and pelvis.
*   **Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen** demonstrated a homogenous non-enhancing retroperitoneal mass measuring approximately 17 x 21 cm with a mixed echogenic pattern in its anterolateral region. The mass occupied the whole of the abdomen, displacing the pancreas and left ureter anteriorly and across the midline. There was a focus of calcification seen at the periphery of the lesion, and there was a loss of fat planes with the adjacent gut loops.
*   **Exploratory Laparotomy:** A large cystic mass with solid areas weighing approximately 7 kg was found adherent to the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon. 
*   **Tumor Resection:** The tumor was resected en masse along with the adherent large bowel and a primary colo-colic anastomosis was performed.

**Pathology:** 
Gross examination of the specimen revealed a 29 x 20 x 15 cm mass with marked congestion and a multinodular external surface. The cut section revealed a multicystic mass with solid areas. Microsections showed a biphasic (epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation) malignant tumor with solid and cystic components infiltrating through the wall of the adherent bowel. Resection margins were free from tumor. One of the sections showed a small amount of residual renal tissue.

**Postoperative Course:** The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was followed up for six months without recurrence.

**Plan:** Patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointments to ensure continued stability.
