Text 1 focuses more on the initial clinical presentation and imaging without the detailed pathology.\n*   **Emphasis on Imaging Techniques:** Text 2 provides a more comprehensive discussion of each imaging modality (CT, Ultrasound, MRI) and how they contributed to the diagnosis.\n*   **Patient History:** Text 2 includes a more complete patient history: gravid 3, para 1.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI'd rate the overall similarity between the two notes as **High (8/10)**. They share a very similar clinical scenario, treatment approach, and initial outcomes. However, the *final diagnosis* is the critical divergence, driven by the detailed pathology information presented in Text 2.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the comparison (e.g., the diagnostic process, the role of imaging, or the differences in the note's structure)?"}}
