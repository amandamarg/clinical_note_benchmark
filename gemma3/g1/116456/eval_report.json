Text 2 is a full clinical report, with a narrative style describing the entire case, from initial presentation to final outcome.\n*   **Specific Findings:** Text 2 includes details not present in Text 1, like the weight of the excised mass (230g) and the specific differential diagnoses considered (fibroma, ossifying fibroma, etc.).\n*   **Terminology:** Text 2 uses more specialized medical terminology (e.g., \"lateral limb modification,\" \"intraoral vestibular degloving incision\").\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI'd estimate a similarity score of **75-80%**.  The core presentation and key findings are almost identical. However, Text 2 builds upon this foundation with a much richer and more detailed clinical report.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the comparison, such as the differences in diagnostic terminology or the surgical procedures described?"}}
