**Subject:** Evaluation of Facial Mass and Dental Displacement

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today complaining of pain and a growth in the mouth for the past 5 years. The pain is described as a dull, gnawing sensation. The growth is located on the left side of the upper gums and has been progressively increasing in size over time, causing difficulty in eating and swallowing. 

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a road traffic accident 5 years ago resulting in injuries to the front teeth, lower lip, and left side of the face. 

**Physical Examination Findings:**
*   A large, palpable mass is present on the left side of the upper gums.
*   The mass measures approximately 10 cm x 6 cm and is described as diffuse swelling involving the lower two-thirds of the left side of the face, extending from the infraorbital region to the lower border of the mandible and from the midline to the left preauricular region.
*   The mass is reddish-pale, exophytic with a lobulated surface and is fixed to the left maxillary alveolus and palate.
*   The mass is firm and tender with an irregular surface.
*   Bleeding spots are distributed randomly on the surface of the growth.
*   Upper posterior teeth are displaced and attached to the palatal side of the mass.

**Imaging:**
*   Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA) was performed. The CTA revealed a soft-tissue shadow with calcifications measuring approximately 10 cm x 6 cm. The shadow is not involving the mandible but is causing destruction of the maxilla in the premolar region. No irregular feeder vessels were identified. 

**Treatment Plan:** Patient will be managed with Weber F.  This will involve a series of procedures and follow-up appointments to monitor progress.
