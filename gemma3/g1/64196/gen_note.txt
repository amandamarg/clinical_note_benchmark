**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Shoulder Dislocation and Axillary Artery Injury

**History of Presenting Illness:** 

The patient presents following a ski fall resulting in a dislocated shoulder. The patient reports a frontal dislocation. Initial reduction attempts were unsuccessful and necessitated general anesthesia. 

**Clinical Findings:**

*   Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient denied neurological dysfunction or pulse deficit.
*   During the second reduction attempt, a hematoma in the deltopectoral region was observed, accompanied by a loss of palpable peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia.
*   A CT scan revealed a compressive hematoma in the axillary region, a disruption of the axillary artery flow, and bilateral pulmonary embolism, previously unknown.
*   Following successful reduction in the operating room, an arteriography was performed, revealing a disruption of the axillary artery with extravasation of contrast near the humeral head.
*   An angioplasty balloon was utilized to control proximal bleeding, followed by an incision at the pectoralis major muscle and hematoma decompression.
*   The bilateral pulmonary embolism is suspected to be related to compression of the axillary vein during the shoulder dislocation, though this remains unconfirmed.
*   The patient received intravenous heparin and subsequently oral anticoagulant therapy.
*   Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a good morphologic and hemodynamic result.

**Postoperative Course:**

The patient has experienced no neurological or vascular complications postoperatively. However, they presented with partial functional disability, likely due to distal brachial plexus stunning, as evidenced by an electromyogram. 

**Plan:** 

I will continue to monitor the patient's progress closely to ensure a successful recovery.
