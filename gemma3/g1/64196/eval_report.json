They are **extremely similar**, representing essentially the same clinical event described from slightly different perspectives. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key similarities and a rough estimate of their similarity:\n\n**High Degree of Overlap (Approximately 85-95% Similarity)**\n\n* **Core Event:** Both notes describe the same fundamental event: a patient presenting with a ski-related anterior shoulder dislocation.\n* **Timeline of Events:** The sequence of events is nearly identical:\n    * Initial dislocation and unsuccessful reduction attempts.\n    * General anesthesia used for subsequent attempts.\n    * Observation of a deltopectoral hematoma.\n    * Loss of peripheral pulse and upper limb ischemia.\n    * CT scan revealing axillary artery disruption and pulmonary embolism.\n    * Reduction in the operating room.\n    * Arteriography and intervention (angioplasty, incision, hematoma decompression, anastomosis).\n    * Post-intervention Doppler ultrasound showing improvement.\n    * Postoperative functional disability (brachial plexus stunning).\n* **Specific Findings:** Both notes detail the same specific findings:\n    * Hematoma in the deltopectoral region.\n    * Disruption of axillary artery flow.\n    * Bilateral pulmonary embolism.\n    * Electromyogram findings (brachial plexus stunning).\n* **Treatment:** The interventions are identical: heparin, oral anticoagulation, angioplasty, incision, hematoma decompression, end-to-end anastomosis.\n* **Outcome:** Both conclude with a good Doppler ultrasound result and the patient presenting with partial functional disability.\n\n\n**Differences (5-15% Differences)**\n\n* **Level of Detail:** Text 2 provides a slightly more detailed procedural description, particularly around the vascular intervention (thromboembolectomy, end-to-end anastomosis). Text 1 is more concise.\n* **Language/Style:**  Text 2 is written in English with some phrases and terminology commonly used in more detailed surgical reports. Text 1 is more concise and uses simpler language.\n* **Initial Presentation:** Text 2 states the patient had no loss of consciousness, while Text 1 doesn\u2019t explicitly state this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese notes are remarkably similar. They represent variations of the same clinical case. If you were comparing them for a differential diagnosis or treatment planning, the core information would be identical.  The differences are primarily stylistic and represent the typical variations found when different medical professionals document the same event.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of this comparison (e.g., a particular detail in the treatment plan, or the diagnostic findings)?"}}
