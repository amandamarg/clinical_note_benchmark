**Subjective:**

Patient reports a history of seizures. Patient states they were initially seen at age 5 following an episode of convulsion with loss of consciousness and left hemiplegia. At that time, a CT scan and angiography were performed, and conservative management was initiated. 

A follow-up visit one year later revealed improvement in left limb power to Grade 3-4/5 with the ability to walk with some support. An MRI at that time showed resolution of the hematoma and a gliotic cavity. 

The patient experienced intermittent seizures at age 9, resulting in a subsequent MRI demonstrating the gliotic cavity on T1-weighted imaging and abnormal vessels on T2-weighted imaging, alongside an MR angiogram revealing an arteriovenous malformation (AVM).  The patient was advised to pursue surgical resection of the AVM, but this was declined by the patientâ€™s parents due to the intermittent nature of the seizures. 

A final follow-up visit one year later revealed intractable seizures, and a digital subtraction angiography was performed, confirming the presence of the AVM.  Surgical resection of the AVM was subsequently performed. 

**Plan:**

Physical examination to be performed. Further diagnostic testing will be ordered to assess current neurological status. 

Follow-up appointment scheduled in one month.
