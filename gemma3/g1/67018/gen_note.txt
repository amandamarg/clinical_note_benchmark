**Subject:** Evaluation for Pelvic Tumor

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents today complaining of feeling unwell for two weeks, characterized by appetite loss, nausea, and vomiting.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a history of epilepsy (diagnosed at 56 years old), cardiopulmonary arrest (at 57 years old), peritonitis due to a perforated gastric ulcer, venous thrombosis of the lower limb, and a pulmonary arterial embolism.

**Allergies:** Patient reports allergies to contrast media, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and sodium valproate.

**Referral:** Patient was referred to this department following a surgical evaluation for ileus and an incisional hernia.

**Relevant Findings:**
*   Patient was admitted to surgery and subsequently referred to this department for evaluation.
*   Abdominal plain computed tomography revealed ileus and an incisional hernia.
*   A tumor was identified in the pelvis.
*   Previous surgical history includes omental implantation for a perforated gastric ulcer (10 years prior) and a right ovarian tumor (6 cm diameter with calcification and fatty components) noted on a prior CT scan. This prior tumor was diagnosed as a mature cystic teratoma.
*   Comparison of current and prior CT scans revealed growth and partial solidification of the right ovarian tumor.

**Plan:**  I recommend further investigation with a biopsy and additional diagnostic tests to characterize the tumor. We will discuss treatment options based on the results. Patient instructed to avoid foods and drinks that may exacerbate symptoms. Follow-up appointment scheduled in one week.
