## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be completed*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be completed*]
**Subject:** Orocutaneous Fistula – Left Mandible

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today with a persistent orocutaneous fistula affecting the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible, adjacent to the left submandibular gland.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of a plasmacytoma removed from the medial side of the left mandible 3 years ago.

**Clinical Findings:** CT imaging demonstrates a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous surgical interventions for this fistula have been unsuccessful, primarily due to inadequate management of dead space surrounding the defect.

**Plan:** Patient will undergo surgical repair utilizing the submandibular gland as a pedicled flap to fill the defect and support the oral and cutaneous flaps.

**Procedure:**
The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. It will involve the following steps:
1.  Initial excision of the fistula.
2.  Preparation of the healthy soft tissues.
3.  Extension of the incision to the posterior and anterior directions, following previous incision lines.
4.  Dissection of the superficial layer of the neck fascia in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible.
5.  Exposure of the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible.
6.  Dissection of the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland, preserving the arteriovenous supply and duct.
7.  Mobilization of the submandibular gland.
8.  Preparation of a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and the defect area.
9.  Rotation of the submandibular gland through the tunnel, preserving the pedicle.
10. Stabilization of the gland with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglactin sutures.
11. Closure of the cutaneous site with 5/0 polypropylene sutures.

**Post-Operative Instructions:**  Patient will receive detailed instructions regarding follow-up care and wound management.
