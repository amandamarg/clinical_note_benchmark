**Subject:** Generalized Epilepsy & Right Occipital Lobe Lesion

**History of Presenting Illness:**

**Past Medical History:** 
*   Generalized Epilepsy (referred to Neurosurgery)
*   Dyslipidemia
*   Allergy to Amoxicillin
*   Right Hip Surgery (2 years ago, post-traffic accident)
*   No reported visual disorders (as reported by ophthalmologists).

**Medications:**

**Examination Findings:** 
*   Increased reflexes in the left leg.
*   Clinical examination revealed a lesion in the right parietal-occipital lobe. 
*   Post-surgical MRI confirmed the existence of a lesion in the right occipital lobe, compatible with a low-grade glioma. 

**Imaging:** 
*   CT Scan (without contrast) revealed a lesion in the right parietal-occipital lobe – Dimensions: 7.5 × 2 × 4.6 cm, with a 1 cm middle line shift to the left and elevation of the right occipital horn.
*   Post-surgical MRI confirmed the findings. 

**Procedure:** 
*   Occipital craniotomy performed for biopsy. Tumor was resected with the use of a microscope and CUSA. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (motorsensory and visual evoked potentials) and neuronavigation were utilized during the procedure.

**Follow-up:** 
Blood exams did not reveal any numerical or functional disorders.  The patient is scheduled for continued monitoring and further management will be determined based on the biopsy results.
