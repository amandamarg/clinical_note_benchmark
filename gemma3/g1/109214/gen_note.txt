**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Aneurysm Management – Left ICA

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reports a history of headaches. 

**Examination Findings:** 

Patient reports a history of headaches.  Significant findings from imaging studies are as follows:

*   **MRI:** Initial MRI scan revealed a giant aneurysm in the left Internal Carotid Artery (ICA).
*   **Angiogram:** Subsequent angiogram demonstrated a large para-ophthalmic aneurysm within the left ICA, measuring approximately 26x19 mm with a wide neck of 14 mm. The angiogram showed good collaterals with a patent anterior and PCOM artery. A balloon occlusion test was performed and was negative for any neurological change during 20 minutes of balloon occlusion with blood pressure challenge. 
*   **Angiogram – Follow-up:**  Angiograms performed at 6 months and 2 years continued to demonstrate retrograde filling of the left ICA para-ophthalmic aneurysm through the PCOM artery, with no antegrade intracranial flow.
*   **Angiogram – 2 Year Follow-up:** Continued retrograde filling through the PCOM artery.

**Treatment:** Parent vessel occlusion was performed.

**Outcome:** Patient remained asymptomatic after treatment. The aneurysm was considered to occlude overtime considering competing antegrade intracranial flow.  Patient was transferred to our institution for continued management due to persistent retrograde filling of the aneurysm.

**Follow-up:**  Scheduled for continued monitoring.
