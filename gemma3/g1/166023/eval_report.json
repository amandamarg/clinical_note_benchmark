They are essentially mirror images of each other. The differences are minor variations in wording and phrasing.\n\n**In short, the similarity is extremely high \u2013 essentially 99% or greater.**\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect, such as the diagnostic imaging details or the treatment timeline?"}}
