**Interventions:**
*   Patient was placed on a backboard and cervical collar by field responders and resuscitated with intravenous fluids during transport.
*   Patient was intubated and sedated for airway protection due to low Glasgow Coma Scale.
*   Emergently taken to the operating room for a craniotomy performed by the neurosurgical team.
*   Following the craniotomy, an emergent closed reduction of the left hip was performed under general anesthesia.

**Additional Findings:**
*   Facial lacerations were noted.
