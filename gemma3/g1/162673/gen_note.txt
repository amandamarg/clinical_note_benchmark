**Subject:** Urinary Bladder Carcinoma - Radical Cystectomy

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents for follow-up following radical cystectomy performed for urinary bladder carcinoma.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of bladder exstrophy with subsequent dehiscence and ileal conduit urinary diversion performed six months prior to presentation.

**Physical Exam:** Relevant findings noted during examination are not detailed in this note.

**Diagnostic Studies:**
*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** Revealed a mildly enhancing nodular lesion on the right side of the lower abdomen superficially, confined to the urinary bladder.
*   **Biopsy:** Results were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma.
*   **Routine Hematological Evaluation, Liver Function Tests, and Chest Radiograph:** All results were normal.

**Procedure:** Radical cystectomy with resection of the urinary bladder, a cuff of the surrounding abdominal wall, and pelvic lymph node dissection. Post-operative repair included mobilization and suturing of the peritoneum on both sides and the recti muscles in the midline. The skin defect was resurfaced with an extended groin flap from the left side and covered with a split thickness skin graft. 

**Pathology:** Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma with infiltration into the underlying muscle (pT2a) and dense lymphocytic infiltration of the stroma. All resected margins and deeper plane of resection were negative for tumor.

**Post-Operative Course:** Patient developed a small collection beneath the flap, which was successfully drained by removal of two stitches and daily dressings. The site granulated well and healed without significant additional scarring.

**Plan:** Patient to continue with scheduled follow-up appointments and check-ups to monitor for recurrence.
