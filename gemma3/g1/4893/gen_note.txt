**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. Smith
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Physician:** Dr. Brown

**Subject:** Evaluation of Wound Dehiscence and Hardware Exposure – Left Knee

**History of Present Illness:**

Mrs. Smith presented to our unit four weeks post-operative from a staged revision total hip arthroplasty following a secondary infection. She underwent a staged revision process following an initial infection presenting with fever, suppuration, and wound healing failure. This necessitated a two-stage revision, including removal of the previous endoprosthesis with enlarged osteotomy, placement of a cement spacer with antibiotics, and ultimately, a new coated silver total femoral prosthesis.  She was subsequently referred to our unit for evaluation of a wound dehiscence with hardware exposure on the left knee.

**Pertinent Medical History:**

*   Prior total left hip arthroplasty performed at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain.
*   Eight years post-operative, she experienced progressive hip pain exacerbated by ambulation.
*   Radiological findings following initial hip arthroplasty included extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component and a femoral pseudo-tumor.

**Post-Operative Course:**

Following the final revision total hip arthroplasty, Mrs. Smith presented with a wound dehiscence and hardware exposure on the left knee. She underwent retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap in the operating room. Initial consideration of a lateral gastrocnemius flap was deemed unsuitable due to significant scarring and atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle. Ultimately, a free flap was utilized. Examination of the receptor vessels revealed a lack of viable vessels and a dissected descending genicular artery with small caliber and calcified plaques. 

**Current Status:** Wound dehiscence with hardware exposure – left knee.
