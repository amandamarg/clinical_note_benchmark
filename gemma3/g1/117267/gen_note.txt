**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** Mrs. X

**Physician:** Dr. Y, Plastic Surgeon

**Subject:** Breast Reconstruction â€“ DIEP Flap

**History:** Patient Mrs. X presented for DIEP flap reconstruction following a left breast mastectomy. She has a significant medical history including a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus, currently managed with a lumbar peritoneal shunt tube. The shunt tube is located within the left trunk, having pierced the intervertebral lumbar and traveled through the subcutaneous layer, entering the abdominal cavity from the outer edge of the left rectus abdominal muscle. 

**Procedure:** DIEP Flap Reconstruction with Shunt Management.  A skin incision was made around the circumference of the flap, and dissection was performed down to the muscle fascia. The shunt tube was confirmed above the fascia on the left side of the abdomen. The perforator vessel passing through the right rectus sheath was confirmed via color Doppler ultrasound on the day prior to surgery. The flap pedicle was prepared for reconstruction on the right side.  The shunt tube was temporarily withdrawn from the abdominal cavity during flap elevation and reinserted upon closure of the donor site.

**Post-Operative Status:** Patient reports feeling good. Monitoring for proper healing and adherence to post-operative instructions.

**Plan:**  Schedule follow-up appointment in one week. Continued monitoring for wound healing and shunt function.
