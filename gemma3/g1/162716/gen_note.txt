**Subject:** Composite Resection and Reconstruction â€“ Post-Procedure Note

**History:** Patient has a history of radiation treatment for squamous carcinoma of the left lower jaw.

**Reason for Visit:** Post-operative follow-up following composite resection and reconstruction.

**Procedure:** The patient underwent a composite resection and reconstruction. During the procedure, dissection of the superior thyroid artery revealed inadequate blood flow. Attempts to improve flow with warm saline, xylocaine solution, and papaverine were unsuccessful. 

Three options were considered: (1) Exploration of the right neck for vascular access, (2) Utilization of a vein graft and anastomosis with the facial artery on the left side, or (3) Retrograde vascularization of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. 

We elected to proceed with retrograde vascularization of the flap via the distal end of the peroneal vessels. The arterial anastomosis between the distal end of the peroneal artery and the left facial artery was successfully completed. Post-anastomosis arterial flow is now confirmed to be adequate.

**Current Status:** The procedure was successful. Patient is being closely monitored for the next few days to assess healing. 

**Recommendations:** Close follow-up is recommended to monitor for signs of complications. Patient instructed to contact the office with any questions or concerns.
