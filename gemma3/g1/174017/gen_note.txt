## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Please insert patient’s name here*]
**Date:** [Date - *Please insert date here*]
**Subject:** Orocutaneous Fistula – Surgical Plan

**History:** Patient presents with a persistent orocutaneous fistula. Patient has a history of a plasmacytoma removed from the medial side of the left mandible three years ago. Patient was referred to our clinic for evaluation and management of this fistula.

**Examination Findings:** CT imaging demonstrates a defect located between the left side of the mouth floor and the basis of the left mandible, neighboring the left submandibular gland. Previous surgical interventions have been unsuccessful in closing the fistula, attributed to ineffective management of dead space surrounding the defect.

**Plan:** Surgical intervention will be performed utilizing a submandibular gland pedicled flap to address the fistula.

**Procedure:**
The patient will undergo the procedure under general anesthesia. The following steps will be performed:
1.  Initial excision of the fistula with preparation of healthy soft tissues.
2.  Extension of the incision to the posterior and anterior directions, following previously established incision lines.
3.  Dissection of the superficial layer of the neck fascia in the subplatysmal plane to reach the base of the mandible.
4.  Exposure of the submandibular gland and the base of the mandible.
5.  Dissection of the soft tissues surrounding the submandibular gland, protecting the arteriovenous supply and duct.
6.  Mobilization of the gland.
7.  Preparation of a soft tissue tunnel between the submandibular space and the defect area.
8.  Rotation of the submandibular gland through the tunnel, preserving the pedicle.
9.  Suturing of the gland to the recipient site with 3/0 reabsorbable polyglaction sutures for stabilization.
10. Closure of the cutaneous site with 5/0 polypropylene sutures via mattress sutures.

**Post-Operative Instructions:** Detailed post-operative instructions will be provided. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled.
