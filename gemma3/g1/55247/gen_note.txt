**Subject:** Right Thigh Pain - Surgical Intervention

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today complaining of significant pain in the right thigh. Patient reports this pain began following a recent road traffic accident and a history of a previous fracture in the right femur sustained two years prior, treated with intramedullary nailing.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a previous right femur fracture treated with intramedullary nailing sustained in a road traffic accident two years prior.

**Current Examination:** On examination, patient exhibits significant pain in the right thigh. Patient reports difficulty moving the leg due to the pain. There is no open wound observed on the right thigh.

**Radiographic Findings:** AP and lateral radiographs demonstrate a 30° varus angulation of the femoral nail and 30° anterior angulation.

**Treatment:** Following unsuccessful attempts at nail correction, a surgical intervention was performed. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position under spinal anesthesia. The surgical approach involved a lateral incision at the fracture site under image intensifier guidance. Tissue was divided layer by layer until the fracture site and fibrous tissue were cleared. Initially, a partially weakening technique followed by manual straightening was attempted, but this failed. Subsequently, the nail was fully cut into two pieces with the distal and proximal locking screws removed. Manual traction was applied as a distraction to fully visualize the apex of angulation. Continuous saline was used to flush the wound. 

**Plan:** Patient will return for a follow-up visit in one week to assess wound healing and monitor progress.
