**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Bilateral Hip and Knee Pain

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presents with bilateral hip and knee joint pain exacerbated by walking, accompanied by a progressive limitation in the range of hip motion and walking ability distance.

**Past Medical History:**

*   **Hip:** Unsuccessful closed reduction of the left hip joint at age 11, resulting in a 9-month spica cast immobilization. History of right nasolacrimal stenosis with two surgical interventions at ages 3 and 8; right inguinal hernia with two surgical interventions at ages 1 and 3.
*   **Dental:** Suspected dentine dysplasia with clinically normal appearing crowns, hypermobility, and spontaneous dental abscesses, resulting in tooth loss between ages 22 and 27.
*   **Neurological:** Two episodes of left ear Menier’s disease at ages 33 and 44.
*   **Urological:** History of night bedwetting up to age 11 due to urinary reflux, evolving into left renal regression and hypoplasia, diagnosed at age 22 via renal angiography.
*   **Surgical:** Two surgical interventions for nasolacrimal stenosis, two surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, two surgical interventions for dental issues.
*   **Dermatological:** Multiple recurrences of ingrown toe nail since adolescence.


**Family History:** Born as the last member of a second-degree consanguineous traditional marriage. Mother was 43 at birth. Three sisters and four brothers with no reported history of hip disease.

**Social History:**  [ *To be filled in - e.g., Occupation, Living Situation, etc.*]

**Assessment:**  Bilateral hip and knee joint pain with progressive limitation in range of motion and walking ability, likely secondary to long-standing degenerative joint changes, considering previous episodes of pain and limitations.

**Plan:** Staged bilateral total hip arthroplasties are recommended to address the patient’s pain and functional limitations. Following the arthroplasties, physical therapy will be initiated to optimize range of motion and strength.
