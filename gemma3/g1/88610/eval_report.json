They both detail a 27-year-old female runner who sustained an ankle sprain and underwent a series of tests to investigate the influence of the injury on muscle activation timing.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the key similarities:**\n\n*   **Patient Profile:** Both texts describe the same patient \u2013 a 27-year-old female runner.\n*   **Injury History:** They both detail the same event \u2013 an inversion right ankle sprain during a camping trip.\n*   **Testing Protocol:** The core of the study (prone leg extension testing with EMG recording) is described identically in both texts, including the specific muscles monitored, the equipment used, and the data processing method (10% threshold for muscle activation, referencing hamstring activation time).\n*   **Results:** Both texts report the same findings: the patient initially functioned at 60% of her optimal level at two weeks post-injury and 95% pain-free at eight weeks, with the EMG data confirming the influence of the injury on muscle activation timing.\n*   **Research Ethics:** Both texts reference the CMCC Research Ethics Board approval.\n*   **Data Processing:** The methods for analyzing the EMG data (rectification, smoothing, bias removal, etc.) are identical.\n\n**Differences (Minor):**\n\n*   **Level of Detail:** Text 2 provides significantly more detail \u2013 more specifics about the EMG equipment, the data acquisition system, and the smoothing technique used. It includes citations to Bullock-Saxton et al.\n*   **Narrative Style:** Text 2 is written in a more verbose, descriptive style, adding more background and context to the experimental procedures.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's reasonable to say that Text 2 is a substantially expanded and more detailed version of Text 1. They are, at their core, recounting the same experimental case study.\n\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of their similarity or difference, such as the differences in the EMG data processing techniques?"}}
