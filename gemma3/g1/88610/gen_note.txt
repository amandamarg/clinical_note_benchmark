## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Right Ankle Sprain - Follow-Up

**History of Presenting Illness:** 
Patient reports a right ankle sprain sustained while camping, following participation in a research study documenting muscle onset timing of the posterior leg and trunk muscles during prone leg extension. Patient was part of the asymptomatic control group within the study.

**Examination Findings:**
Patient reports that X-rays revealed no fractures following the injury. Patient states that at two weeks post-injury, function was approximately 60% of optimum, and at eight weeks post-injury, pain-free running was achieved with minimal loss of function (95%).  Patient reports significant improvement in ankle function.

**Treatment Plan:**
1.  Scheduled for testing to assess the potential influence of the ankle sprain on muscle activation timing during prone leg extension compared to a control group.
2.  Continue with current weight-bearing exercises and range of motion exercises as previously advised.
3.  Monitor weight closely.

**Relevant History:**
*   Participated in research study: Muscle onset timing of posterior leg and trunk muscles during prone leg extension (asymptomatic control group).
*   No prior leg or spine injuries.
*   Study approved by the Research Ethics Board of CMCC.
*   Testing protocol was consistent across the three experimental days.
