**Subject:** Right Knee Pain – Provisional Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis

**History of Presenting Illness:** 
Patient presents today complaining of pain localized to the medial aspect of the right knee. The pain is non-radiating and is relieved by rest, but exacerbated by squatting and sitting cross-legged. Patient reports difficulty climbing stairs.

**Past Medical History:** 
Patient reports a history of a patellar fracture approximately 4 years ago, treated with open reduction and internal fixation with implant removal 2 years ago. 

**Physical Examination:**
On examination, tenderness was noted along the medial aspect of the right knee joint. A curved scar mark was identified over the anterior aspect of the right knee joint. Range of motion is full. Moderate pain was observed on the medial side during flexion and extension. No distal neurovascular deficit was detected.

**Imaging:**
Weight-bearing antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the right knee were ordered. Examination of the radiographs revealed multiple pieces of broken circlage wire surrounding the knee joint, with one piece migrating posteriorly. 

**Diagnosis:** Provisional diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the right knee joint. 

**Assessment:** 
The patient’s history suggests that the surgeon who performed the initial implant removal only removed the K wires, leaving behind the circlage wires which broke into multiple pieces over time due to repeated stresses at the knee joint.

**Plan:** 
Given the presence of broken circlage wire and potential for further complications, I advised the patient of the potential need for total knee replacement, along with subsequent removal of broken hardware. I warned the patient to be alert for any changes in the nature of their pain. 

**Patient Response:** Patient refused surgical intervention.
