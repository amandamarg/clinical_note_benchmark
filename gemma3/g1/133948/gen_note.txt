**Subjective:**

Patient presents today reporting a complex history of hip pain and dysfunction. Patient states they initially experienced pain and restricted range of motion in the left hip joint for two months, accompanied by gait disturbance. The pain was exacerbated by hip joint flexion and rotation. 

Patient reports a prior diagnosis of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, initially affecting the left hip, followed by a total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed approximately one year prior. Following the initial THA, the patient subsequently developed pain and limited range of motion in the contralateral hip joint, along with gait disturbance, approximately one year after the first surgery. This was followed by a second THA performed one year after the first THA of the left hip.

At the time of the second surgery, the patient was 7 kg heavier than at the time of the first procedure and developed a moderate moon face, initially overlooked as weight gain. Over the following three months, the patient reported intensifying feelings of helplessness and central obesity with muscle mass reduction in both upper and lower limbs. These symptoms were not significant enough to warrant further investigation. One year after the second surgery, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiology due to a progressive worsening of central symptoms. 

**Objective:**

*   Physical Examination: Gait disturbance secondary to hip pain, exacerbated by hip joint flexion and rotation.
*   Imaging:
    *   Initial Anteroposterior view of left hip revealed sclerosis and collapse of the femoral head and dysplasia of the hip.
    *   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan showed increased amount of joint fluid and bone marrow edema in the left hip.
    *   Detected femoral head necrosis on the contralateral side (no pain reported).

**Assessment:**

Complex history of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, initially affecting the left hip, followed by multiple THA procedures.  Significant contributing factors include weight gain, central obesity, and muscle mass reduction.

**Plan:**

Continue regular outpatient follow-up with Cardiology due to progressive central symptoms.
