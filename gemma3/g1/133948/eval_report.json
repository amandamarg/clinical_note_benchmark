This is the core, initiating problem.\n* **Multiple THA Procedures:** Both patients have undergone two total hip arthroplasties (THAs) \u2013 one on each hip \u2013 due to the osteonecrosis. This is a critical shared element.\n* **Symptoms:** Both patients present with:\n    * Pain in the affected hip joint.\n    * Restricted range of motion (ROM) in the affected hip.\n    * Gait disturbance (difficulty walking) exacerbated by hip movement.\n* **Weight Gain & Associated Issues:** Both patients experienced weight gain after their surgeries, which contributed to further complications. The \"moon face\" symptom is present in both.\n* **Progression of Symptoms:**  Both notes detail a gradual worsening of symptoms over time, requiring additional interventions.\n* **Imaging Findings:** The imaging results (sclerosis, collapse of the femoral head, bone marrow edema, joint fluid) are identical in both cases.\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n* **Later Complications:** The second note details a significantly more complex cascade of events. The patient developed Cushing's Syndrome (due to a benign adrenal adenoma) which wasn't present in the first note. This is the major divergence.\n* **Timeline:** The second patient's timeline is considerably longer, spanning several years and multiple specialist referrals.\n* **Detailed History:** The second note includes a much richer and more detailed medical history, including menstrual irregularities, depression, and a previously overlooked abdominal mass.\n* **Specialist Referrals:** The second patient received referrals to cardiology, endocrinology, urology, and potentially other departments, reflecting the complexity of their case.\n* **Treatment:** The second patient\u2019s treatment involved adrenalectomy and ongoing observation.\n\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI'd estimate a similarity score of **75-80%**.  The core problem (osteonecrosis and THAs) is extremely similar, but the second patient\u2019s case quickly branches out into a completely different, more complex, and prolonged clinical picture.\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on a specific aspect of the comparison (e.g., the progression of the diseases, the diagnostic pathways, or the treatment strategies)?"}}
