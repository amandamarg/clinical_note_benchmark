This includes:\n    *   Initial trauma (fall) leading to a proximal ulnar shaft fracture and post-traumatic arthritis.\n    *   Previous left elbow arthrodesis (fusion) performed at age 18.\n    *   Development of a hypertrophic nonunion and subsequent attempts at conservative treatment.\n    *   Desire to convert the arthrodesis to an arthroplasty (replacement) due to functional limitations.\n\n*   **Core Surgical Procedure:**  Both notes detail the same surgical intervention: a combined approach to repair the ulnar nonunion and convert the elbow arthrodesis to an arthroplasty. The specific steps, like the posterior incision, elevation of the muscle flap, neuroplasty of the ulnar nerve, triceps splitting approach, and use of the ulnar component as an intramedullary device, are identical.\n\n*   **Outcome:** Both notes ultimately describe a successful outcome \u2013 the patient achieves near full ROM, minimal pain, and returns to work with a brace.\n\n\n**Key Differences & Nuances:**\n\n*   **Level of Detail:** Text 2 is significantly more detailed than Text 1. It provides much greater specifics about the surgical technique (e.g., precise angles of the osteotomy, the specific type of Stryker system used, the method of preparing the canals, the precise ROM achieved at follow-up).  Text 1 is more of a summary of the key events.\n\n*   **Surgical Technique Variations:** Although the *goal* of the procedure is the same, there are slight differences in the execution. Text 2 provides details about the use of bone graft taken from the resected radial head. Text 1 simply states that bone graft was used.\n\n*   **Patient Engagement and Follow-Up:** Text 2 includes a more detailed account of the patient\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process and his active desire to undergo the procedure. It also highlights the difficulty in attempting to contact the patient for follow-up.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI\u2019d rate the similarity between these two notes as **very high \u2013 approximately 85-90%**. They essentially describe the same clinical scenario and surgical procedure, but Text 2 offers a much richer and more detailed account.\n\nDo you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of the similarities or differences?"}}
