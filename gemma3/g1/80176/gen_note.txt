**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient’s Name]
**Date:** [Today’s Date]
**Physician:** Dr. [Doctor’s Name]

**Subject:** Left Forearm and Elbow Pain – Post-Trauma Management

**History of Present Illness:**

Mr. [Patient’s Name] presents today with pain in his left arm following a fall approximately three months ago. He reports a sharp pain in the proximal forearm. The patient describes a worsening of pain and reduced range of motion in the left arm.

**Past Medical History:**

*   Previous left elbow surgery for post-traumatic arthritis performed at age 18.
*   History of minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture following the initial fall, which resulted in a hypertrophic nonunion. Treated with a cast for three months.

**Examination Findings:**

*   Range of Motion: Limited to 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. Elbow fused at 90 degrees.
*   Motor and Sensory Exam: Normal at the hand.
*   Radiographs: Showed a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture and an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware.

**Procedure:**

Following discussion of surgical options at the clinic visit three months post-fall, Mr. [Patient’s Name] elected to proceed with a combined surgical approach to repair the ulnar nonunion and convert the elbow arthrodesis to arthroplasty.  The procedure involved a posterior incision over the elbow, requiring elevation of a prior muscle flap used for soft tissue coverage. The ulnar nerve was encased in scar tissue and required a meticulous neuroplasty. A triceps splitting approach was utilized, and multiple buried pins were inserted. The stem of the ulnar component was utilized as an intramedullary device. The patient was placed in a supine position.

**Plan:**

Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor progress. Patient was advised to contact the office with any concerns.
