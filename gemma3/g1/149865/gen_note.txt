**Patient Name:** [Patient Name - To be added]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Right Leg Implant Removal – Follow-Up

**History of Presenting Illness:**

Patient presented today reporting a non-healing ulcer on the right leg, which has been present for approximately one year. The patient has previously received non-operative management without improvement.

**Past Medical History:**

*   Type 2 Diabetes – Diagnosed 5 years ago.
*   Right Tibial and Fibular Plate Implantation (UAE) – 3 years ago.

**Relevant History:**

*   Previous attempt to remove the implant 6 months ago at another hospital resulted in removal of one of the five proximal locking screws, with the remaining screws stripped.
*   Standard screwdriver and AO Synthes screw extraction kit were unsuccessful in removing the screws.
*   Due to the unavailability of a carbide drill, a novel technique utilizing stainless steel metal cutting blades (similar to those used for locks and padlocks) was employed.

**Procedure:**

The stainless steel blades were used to carefully cut the remaining stripped headed screws with a to-and-fro motion and firm pressure, creating a space between the locking plate and bone.  The threaded parts of the screws were left in the bone due to concerns regarding further weakening. The procedure took approximately 10 minutes without any heating issues. 

**Current Status:**

The implant has been successfully removed. The patient understands that ongoing monitoring and a follow-up appointment in a few weeks are necessary to assess progress.

**Plan:**

Continue close monitoring and schedule follow-up appointment in [Number] weeks.
