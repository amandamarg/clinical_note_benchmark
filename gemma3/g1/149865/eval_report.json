They are *extremely* similar, representing essentially the same surgical procedure and patient case. Here's a breakdown of the similarities, categorized:\n\n**1. Core Clinical Information (Highly Similar):**\n\n*   **Patient Presentation:** Both describe a 55-year-old male patient presenting with a non-healing ulcer on the right leg, developed over a year.\n*   **Medical History:** Both note the patient\u2019s Type 2 Diabetes (diagnosed 5 years ago) and the prior Right Tibial and Fibular Plate Implantation (UAE) 3 years ago.\n*   **Prior Failed Attempt:**  Crucially, both records detail the previous unsuccessful attempt to remove the implant at another hospital \u2013 one screw was removed, and the remaining screws were stripped.\n*   **Procedure & Technique:** The core surgical technique is identical:  Using stainless steel metal cutting blades (originally described as being used for locks and padlocks) to cut the stripped screws.  The rationale for leaving the threaded portions in the bone is also the same. The duration of the procedure (10 minutes) and the absence of heating issues are also consistent.\n*   **Outcome:**  Both records state the implant was successfully removed.\n\n**2. Detailed Procedural Steps (Almost Identical):**\n\n*   The specific steps within the procedure, such as:\n    *   Creating a space between the locking plate and bone.\n    *   Using the to-and-fro motion with firm pressure.\n    *   Washing the wound with normal saline.\n\n**3.  Minor Differences (Descriptive Variation):**\n\n*   **Terminology:** Text 2 uses slightly more descriptive language (\u201costeotome,\u201d \u201cthreaded parts,\u201d \"Rohit\u2019s technique\") compared to Text 1.  Text 2 provides a more detailed account of the rationale for using the blades \u2013 focusing on avoiding soft tissue injury.\n*   **Naming the Technique:** Text 2 introduces \"Rohit\u2019s technique,\" while Text 1 doesn\u2019t. This is a minor addition and reflects the second physician's personal attribution.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI'd estimate the similarity between these two texts to be **95-98%**. They are, for all practical purposes, describing the exact same clinical event. The differences are primarily stylistic and represent the individual perspectives of the two physicians documenting the case.\n\nDo you want me to delve into a specific aspect of the similarities or differences, such as the rationale for the chosen technique or the potential implications of this type of procedure?"}}
