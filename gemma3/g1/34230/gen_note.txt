**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Not Provided in Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Information Not Provided in Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Nephrology Follow-Up

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient is a [Age - *Information Not Provided in Dialogue*] year old female with a significant history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). She was initially diagnosed following a spontaneous miscarriage during her second trimester of pregnancy in 2009. This led to the development of SLE, characterized by proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, necessitating a kidney biopsy which revealed crescentic focal segmental glomerulonephritis â€“ a type of lupus nephritis.

**Medical History:**

*   **SLE Diagnosis:** Diagnosed in 2009 following a spontaneous miscarriage.
*   **Initial Treatment:** Initially treated with cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and azathioprine, which proved ineffective. Treatment was subsequently modified to mycophenolic acid with the addition of rituximab.
*   **Progression of Renal Disease:** Despite the absence of extra-renal manifestations, her kidney function gradually deteriorated over approximately 4 years, eventually progressing to end-stage kidney disease.
*   **Renal Replacement Therapy:** Initiated peritoneal dialysis concurrently with hydroxychloroquine and low-dose methylprednisolone.

**Additional Findings:**

*   **Infectious Episodes:** Presented with fever on multiple occasions, including three hospitalizations within the past 12 months, all of which were initially inconclusive.  The final hospitalization revealed a high CMV viral load.
*   **Immunoglobulin Abnormalities:**  Experienced low immunoglobulin levels, specifically low IgA, IgG, and IgE, with slightly elevated IgM.  Five pulses of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered.
*   **Respiratory Infections:**  Experienced intermittent upper respiratory infections and acute tonsillitis approximately 2-3 times per year.
*   **Acquired Immunodeficiency:**  Suspected acquired immunodeficiency, leading to monthly intravenous immunoglobulin administration.

**Current Status:**

The patient received a cadaveric kidney transplant in June 2020, demonstrating two shared HLA class matches. She reports doing well post-transplant.

**Plan:**

Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor her progress.
