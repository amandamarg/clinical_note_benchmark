## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Note: Patient name not provided in dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Note: Date not provided in dialogue*]
**Subject:** Follow-up for Pulmonary and Vertebral Lesions

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented for a routine checkup. During the examination, a small nodule was identified in the right lung and a lytic lesion was noted in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.

**Examination Findings:**
*   Initial examination revealed a small nodule in the right lung.
*   Lytic lesion identified in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.
*   Laboratory studies were within normal limits and negative.
*   Physical examination revealed no other significant abnormalities.

**Investigations:**
*   **CT Scan (5 years post-initial findings):** Initially, the pulmonary nodule had slightly increased in size. An increase in the size of the lytic lesion was also observed in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
*   **Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery & Curettage:** Performed to evaluate both the pulmonary lesion and the lytic bone lesion.
    *   Orthopedic surgeons reported that the tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface.
    *   The vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.

**Diagnosis:** Suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor.

**Clinical Course:** Patient has made good postoperative progress over the 41-month clinical course. Imaging examinations (CT and MR) have continued to show the pulmonary and vertebral lesions without evidence of spread.

**Prognosis:** Patient remains disease-free at 41 months post-operation.

**Plan:** Continued monitoring and regular imaging will be necessary.
