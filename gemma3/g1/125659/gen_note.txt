**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information not provided in dialogue, needs to be added here*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Information not provided in dialogue, needs to be added here*]
**Subject:** Chronic Headache & Vascular History

**History of Present Illness:** The patient is a [Age - *Information not provided in dialogue, needs to be added here*] year-old male presenting today with chronic headache. The patient reports the headache began approximately seven months after undergoing endovascular trapping of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk at another institution in June 2002. He initially presented to our institution with progressive dyspnea and dull occipital headache. 

**Past Medical History:**
*   Admission to our institution in June 2002 for treatment of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar trunk.
*   Previous evaluation in November 2001 revealed a tortuous basilar artery without aneurysmal dilatation and an ICA aneurysm.
*   Endovascular trapping of the giant fusiform aneurysm (petrous to cavernous parts of the right ICA) performed at another hospital in June 2002.

**Neurological Examination:** At presentation, the patient exhibited a 6th cranial nerve palsy on the right side and increased deep tendon reflexes in the four extremities. 

**Diagnostic Findings:**
*   MR Imaging: Revealed a giant aneurysm of the basilar artery compressing the brain stem.
*   Cerebral Angiography: Demonstrated a fusiform giant aneurysm involving the basilar trunk with an irregular contour.
*   Additional Findings:  A left anterior inferior cerebellar artery originated just proximal to the basilar trunk aneurysm. A de novo small paraclinoid aneurysm was found on the left ICA. 

**Intervention:**  Prior to endovascular embolization of the basilar trunk aneurysm, a high-flow bypass from the external carotid artery to the middle cerebral artery was performed using a saphenous vein graft to maintain adequate perfusion of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Part of the occluded right ICA was sectioned during surgery. An adequate blood supply to the upper portion of the posterior circulation was maintained via the left posterior communicating artery (PCoA). 

**Plan:**  Review of the patient's file is required.  A follow-up plan will be determined following this review.
