**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Facial Swelling & Mandibular Caries – Garre’s Osteomyelitis

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today complaining of swelling and asymmetry on the right side of the face, which developed approximately three months ago following a periapical infection. The patient was referred to our clinic due to this persistent swelling.

**Examination Findings:**

*   **General:** Patient reports swelling and asymmetry on the right side of the face.
*   **Palpation:** Significant swelling noted on the right side of the face without fluctuation upon palpation. Submandibular lymphadenopathy was observed in the right mandibular region.
*   **Skin:** Skin appearance was normal.
*   **Oral Examination:** A deep caries cavity was identified in the right mandibular first molar tooth. The tooth was not mobile. No other damage to the oral mucosa was present.
*   **Radiographic Examination:** A tunnel-like defect was identified in the cortical bone in the vestibule surface of the inflamed bone, consistent with Garre’s osteomyelitis secondary to the periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Diagnosis:** Garre’s Osteomyelitis secondary to periapical infection of the right mandibular first molar tooth.

**Plan:** Due to the patient’s socioeconomic situation and inability to afford endodontic treatment, a referral to the surgical clinic for dental extraction of the right mandibular first molar is recommended. 

**Note:** Patient expressed understanding of the diagnosis and treatment plan.
