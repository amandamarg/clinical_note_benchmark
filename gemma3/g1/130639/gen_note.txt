**Subject:** Bilateral Total Hip Replacement – Follow-Up

**History:**

The patient is a [Patient Age - *To be filled in*] year-old female presenting for bilateral total hip replacement secondary to osteoarthritis. She has a significant medical history including osteoarthritis in both hips and chronic Hepatitis C virus infection.  She was admitted for surgery arriving in a wheelchair. 

**Surgical Details:**

The patient elected to have the right hip performed first via an anterior approach with 2g of cefazolin administered as antibiotic prophylaxis. An uncemented prosthesis was implanted. The left hip was subsequently performed via a posterior approach with a cemented stem. The acetabulum was affected by bone destruction in both hips, however, the cup was able to be placed at a correct height in the left hip, resulting in a well-tolerated leg length discrepancy considering her previous functional status. 

**Findings:**

*   Pre-operative radiographs were obtained.
*   Radiographs revealed bilateral RDO (Rapid Diagnostic Osteoarthritis).
*   During both procedures, samples were taken for microbiology and histology due to a suspected septic etiology, despite the absence of prior septicemia and elevated inflammatory markers related to her chronic Hepatitis C infection.
*   Four days post-right hip replacement, one of six cultures was positive for *Enterococcus faecium* – no local or systemic signs of infection or pain were present.
*   Synovial biopsy of the right hip revealed fibrosis, chronic inflammation, calcifications, macrophages, and osteoclast giant cells with no acute inflammation.
*   Urine cultures were negative.
*   Antibiotic treatment was not initiated due to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria not being met.

**Post-Operative Course:**

The patient tolerated both procedures well.  The right hip was performed 5 days post-procedure and the left hip was performed 5 days post-procedure without complications.

**Plan:**

Follow-up requirements will be discussed with the patient.  The patient is advised to contact the clinic with any questions or concerns.
