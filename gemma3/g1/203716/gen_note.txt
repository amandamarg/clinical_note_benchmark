**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date of Note - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Chronic Abdominal Wound & Subphrenic Collection

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents with a discharging wound in the upper abdomen, noted approximately one month prior. The wound is a result of a previous surgical history.

**Past Surgical History:** Patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy six months prior at another medical college for a suspected peptic perforation. This was managed with an omental patch. A subsequent burst abdomen occurred on the fourth post-operative day, treated conservatively.

**Current Condition:** Patient reports a discharging wound in the upper abdomen, initially stemming from a previous surgical event. The wound was initially covered with a split-thickness skin graft four months prior, with a subsequent serous discharge from a small ulcer noted five months post-grafting, managed with gauge pieces applied one to three times daily. 

**Physical Examination:** 
*   A 12 cm x 5 cm elliptical skin graft is present over the mid-abdomen.
*   A 1 cm x 1 cm depressed ulcer is present in the upper portion of the graft, with pale granulation tissue and serous oozing. 
*   Several spots of exuberant pale granulation tissue are noted elsewhere.
*   Palpation reveals a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft. 

**Laboratory Findings:** 
*   Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL
*   Total WBC Count: 11.6 x 103/mm3
*   Total Serum Protein: 7.9 g/dL
*   Serum Albumin: 3.5 g/dL

**Imaging:** Ultrasound revealed a left subphrenic collection measuring 8 cm x 7 cm. 

**Assessment:** Chronic abdominal wound with possible missed pathology following previous surgical intervention. 

**Plan:** 
*   Scheduled follow-up appointment.
*   Recommendation for CT scan to further evaluate the area and determine the cause of the current problem. 
*   Consultation with a wound care specialist is recommended. 

**Family Informed:** Yes.
