## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Redacted for Privacy]
**Date:** [Date of Note - To Be Filled]
**Subject:** Evaluation of Left Leg Pain, Swelling, and Radiopaque Mass

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented with complaints of pain and swelling in the left leg, initially noted one month prior to presentation. Symptoms are characterized by erythematous changes on the anterolateral aspect of the left leg and a developing fluid-filled, erythematous mass.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a significant past medical history of liver cirrhosis. 

**Past Surgical History:** Patient reports a tibial plateau fracture with open reduction and internal fixation performed 18 years ago.  Additionally, the patient reports a sciatic nerve injury sustained at the time of the fracture. Eight years later, the patient underwent an open reduction and internal fixation for a distal femur fracture with femoral artery rupture, requiring stent insertion in the femoral artery. 

**Neurological Examination:** Patient reports limited motion in the ankle and toes, and sensory reduction in the foot due to the longstanding sciatic nerve injury. Specifically, ankle dorsiflexion is 0 degrees and ankle plantar flexion is 5 degrees.  The patient also exhibits clawing deformity of all toes. Sensory examination reveals complete loss of sensation in the first web space and on the medial aspect of the foot, with sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation. 

**Physical Examination Findings:** During examination, a draining sinus developed spontaneously on the erythematous mass, discharging a thick, chalk-like fluid via the shiny skin.

**Angiographic Findings:** Angiography revealed an obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation. Radiographs taken 10 years prior to presentation also demonstrate a previously noted mass on the left leg.

**Assessment:**  Chronic left leg pain and swelling with a developing mass, likely related to a long-standing obstruction of the popliteal artery and possible chronic inflammatory process. 

**Prognosis:** Unfortunately, the outlook is not very good.
