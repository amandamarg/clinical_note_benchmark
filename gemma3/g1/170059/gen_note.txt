**Subject:** Follow-up for Lung and Vertebral Lesions

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented for a routine checkup. During the examination, a small nodule was identified in the right lung and a lytic lesion was discovered in the fifth lumbar vertebral bone.

**Physical Exam:** Initial examination revealed no significant findings beyond the identified lung nodule and vertebral lesion.

**Investigations:**

*   **CT Scan (5 years post-initial findings):** Demonstrated slight increase in size of the pulmonary nodule and an increase in the size of the lytic lesion in the left transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
*   **Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) & Curettage:** Performed on the pulmonary lesion and lytic bone lesion.
    *   **Findings during VATS & Curettage:** The tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. The vertebral lesion was completely confined within the vertebral bone and was not connected to the spinal canal.

**Diagnosis:** Suspected metastases from an unknown primary tumor.

**Post-Operative Course:** Patient made good postoperative progress and has remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.  Continued to demonstrate no significant findings beyond the pulmonary and vertebral lesions with imaging examinations including CT and MR imaging.

**Plan:** Continued close monitoring with imaging as needed.
