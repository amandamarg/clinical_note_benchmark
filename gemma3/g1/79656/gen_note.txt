**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Neck Pain & Dysphagia - Surgical Evaluation

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today with a history of neck pain and dysphagia. 

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a significant history of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple cervical spine surgeries. 

**Surgical History:**
*   **2009:** Anterior Cervical Decompression Fusion (ACDF) from C5 to C7 performed for neck and arm pain. Developed nonunion with screw loosening and subsequent revision.
*   **2010:** Revision ACDF extension from C3 to C7 performed.
*   **Postoperative Course (2010 Revision):** Developed a superficial surgical site infection requiring irrigation and debridement with antibiotics. Experienced significant dysphagia following the third surgery, necessitating a feeding tube for approximately 1 year. Serial esophagrams were unremarkable.

**Recent Events:** Patient reports a low-energy fall with no change in symptomatology. 

**Imaging:** Routine cervical spine imaging (plain film radiography and CT) revealed nonhealing posterior pseudarthrosis with local kyphosis, screw loosening, plate migration, and air communicating with the plate, raising concern for esophageal perforation. 

**Plan:** Patient underwent direct laryngoscopy, which revealed a pharyngeal defect with exposure of the spinal hardware in the midline. Further evaluation beyond the proximal esophagus was not attempted. The plan was to remove the hardware and then perform a staged revision extension of my previous fusion from a posterior approach.
