**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Not Provided]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Not Provided]
**Subject:** Evaluation of Left Leg Pain, Swelling, and Radiopaque Mass

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presented with pain and swelling in the left leg, initially noted one month prior to presentation. The onset was without specific trauma. Examination revealed erythematous changes on the anterolateral aspect of the left leg, evolving into a fluid-filled, erythematous mass.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a significant past medical history of liver cirrhosis.

**Past Surgical History:**

*   **18 years ago:** Tibial plateau fracture with open reduction and internal fixation. Concurrent sciatic nerve injury.
*   **8 years ago:** Distal femur fracture with femoral artery rupture, treated with open reduction and internal fixation, and stent insertion in the femoral artery.

**Neurological Examination:**

*   Limited motion in the ankle and toes.
*   Sensory reduction in the foot, specifically affecting the first web space and medial aspect.
*   Dorsiflexion grade 0 and plantar flexion grade 3.
*   Clawing deformity of all toes.
*   Reduced sensation in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation.

**Physical Examination Findings:**

*   Erythematous changes localized to the anterior aspect of the middle of the left leg.
*   Development of a draining sinus with discharge of a thick, chalk-like fluid through the sinus.
*   Abundant collateral circulation observed on angiography secondary to popliteal artery obstruction.
*   Radiographs taken 10 years prior revealed a previously existing mass.

**Assessment:**

The patient presents with a complex case involving chronic left leg pain, swelling, and a radiopaque mass, likely related to a long-standing issue complicated by vascular obstruction and potential chronic inflammation. The prior tibial plateau fracture, sciatic nerve injury, and femoral artery rupture contribute to the overall complexity of the presentation.

**Prognosis:**

Unfortunately, the prognosis is not favorable, given the long-standing nature of the condition and documented mass observed on prior radiographs.
