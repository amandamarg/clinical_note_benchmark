## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Chronic Abdominal Pain, Weight Loss, and Pelvic Mass

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents for follow-up regarding chronic abdominal pain and weight loss, initially referred to this clinic six months ago. Patient reports a total weight loss of 10 kilograms.

**Past Medical History:** Patient is postmenopausal for 30 years with a negative medical history.

**Physical Examination:** On examination, a hard and mobile mass was palpated in the right iliac fossa. No tenderness was noted.

**Diagnostic Testing:**

*   **Transvaginal Ultrasound:** Revealed a cystic formation in the right adnexal area, with a mixed structure (solid and cystic), smooth and anechoic wall, no papillary projections or septations, and no signs of blood flow (color Doppler evaluation). Left ovary measured 25 x 13 x 11 mm.
*   **Endometrial Ultrasound:**  Observed a polyp of the endometrium with a total thickness of 8 mm. No free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch.
*   **CT Scan:** Identified a 100 x 80 mm cyst with peripheral calcification, attributed to a lesion of the right ovary.
*   **Colonoscopy:**  A benign polyp of the sigmoid colon was excised, and a submucosal round smooth cystic formation of one cm in diameter at the site of the appendix was identified.
*   **Tumor Markers:** Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated at 54 ng/mL (normal range 2 ng/mL).

**Procedure:** Laparotomy was performed, revealing a cystic tumor originating from the appendix, measuring 80 x 90 mm. The uterus and ovaries were noted to be atrophic.  The abdominal viscera were covered with surgical pad gauzes to protect from spillage of the cyst contents.

**Discussion:** The indeterminate ultrasound findings and elevated CEA prompted surgical exploration. The final diagnosis is a pelvic mass.

**Plan:**  Follow-up appointment scheduled in a few weeks to monitor progress.
