**Patient Name:** [Patient Name – *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date – *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Follow-up regarding metastatic adenocarcinoma

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presents today with a longstanding history of multiple masses. He initially noticed these masses several years prior. The patient reports a 20-year history of smoking. There is no significant past medical history prior to the onset of these symptoms.

**Past Medical History:**

*   20-year history of smoking.
*   Three years prior, referred to a surgical clinic for evaluation of masses in the left arm and axilla.
*   Biopsy reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma.
*   Evaluated for possible intestinal primaries at that time.
*   Received radiotherapy of unclear dosage.

**Current Findings:**

Following recurrence of the tumor, the patient was referred to the medical oncology department at our hospital. Examination revealed multiple masses, including:

*   A 140 x 100 x 90 mm lobulated mass in the proximal epiphyses, metaphysis and diaphysis of the left humerus, which was destructing the cortices on multiple sides with a large soft tissue component, and invading and protruding out of the skin.
*   A 123 x 54 x 74 mm mass in the axillary region adjacent to the thoracic wall infiltrating the skin, surrounded by multiple nodular masses of different sizes.
*   Other masses were noted.

**Prior Treatment:**

The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and capecitabine for six cycles, as determined by the tumor council. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was obtained following cessation of chemotherapy, which revealed the described findings. 

**Pathology:**

Biopsy materials were reevaluated in our pathology department and confirmed to be metastatic adenocarcinoma. The report indicated that the mass might be breast originated.
