They are **extremely similar**, representing essentially the same clinical case. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key similarities and why they\u2019re so closely aligned:\n\n**1. Core Clinical Narrative:**\n\n*   **Patient Presentation:** Both texts describe a 13-year-old female presenting with acute abdominal pain, leading to ambulance transport and initial evaluation.\n*   **Diagnosis:** Both definitively identify the patient's condition as a Spontaneous Pancreatic Tumor (SPT) based on CT findings and age/gender.\n*   **Timeline of Events:**  The entire sequence of events\u2014initial presentation, CT scan, referral, surgery, and postoperative course\u2014is described identically in both texts.\n\n**2. Specific Findings & Measurements:**\n\n*   **Tumor Size:** Both records state the initial tumor diameter was 5 cm and the diameter at the hospital was 4 cm.\n*   **CT Findings:** The description of the tumor\u2019s location (pancreatic tail), the surrounding fluid collection, and its relationship to the main pancreatic duct are exactly the same.\n*   **Post-operative Details:** The descriptions of the laparoscopic enucleation (number of trocars, pneumoperitoneum, duration, minimal blood loss), drain placement, amylase levels, and drain removal are identical.\n\n**3. Post-Operative Course & Outcome:**\n\n*   **Pancreatic Fistula:** Both texts report the development of a Grade A pancreatic fistula, confirmed by amylase levels.\n*   **Discharge & Follow-up:** Both describe the patient\u2019s uneventful discharge and the planned long-term surveillance.\n*   **Final Pathological Report:** The confirmation of SPT with negative surgical margin and capsule rupture is stated identically.\n\n**In conclusion:**  These two texts are essentially duplicates of each other. They represent the same surgical case with identical findings, procedures, and outcomes.  It\u2019s highly probable that Text 2 is a verbatim copy of Text 1.\n\nDo you want me to highlight specific sections of the texts that demonstrate the similarities in more detail?"}}
