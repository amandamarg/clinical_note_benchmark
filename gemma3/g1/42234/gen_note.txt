**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Post-Operative Management - Pancreatic Tumor

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented to our hospital following a recent presentation of acute abdominal pain, resulting in transport by ambulance to another facility. 

**Significant Findings:**

Patient reported sudden onset of abdominal pain and subsequent evaluation at another hospital. Imaging studies revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with surrounding fluid collection, identified as a SPT (Spontaneous Pancreatic Tumor) based on CT findings combined with age and gender. The acute abdominal pain was attributed to hemoperitoneum secondary to the rupture of the pancreatic tumor.

**Timeline of Events:**

*   **Initial Presentation:** Patient presented with acute abdominal pain, leading to transport and initial evaluation.
*   **CT Scan:** Initial CT scan revealed a 5 cm cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection. The CT indicated hemoperitoneum due to tumor rupture.
*   **Referral:** Patient was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment, scheduled three months after the initial tumor rupture.
*   **Post-Operative Evaluation (Day 3):** At the time of surgery, the tumor was not palpable, and the CT scan at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, protruding from the pancreatic tail and distant from the main pancreatic duct with the fluid collection having disappeared. Amylase content in the drain fluid was 9710 IU/L, confirming a pancreatic fistula of grade A.
*   **Laparoscopic Enucleation:** Laparoscopic enucleation was performed using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The procedure lasted 126 minutes with minimal blood loss.
*   **Drain Removal:** The drain was removed on postoperative day 4 due to the small volume of fluid.
*   **Discharge:** Patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 with an uneventful course, except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A.

**Pathology:** Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of SPT, with a negative surgical margin and verified capsule rupture of the tumor.

**Plan:** Continued monitoring for pancreatic fistula management and long-term surveillance.
