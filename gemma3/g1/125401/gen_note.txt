**Subject:** Melena â€“ Gastric Mass Management

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents today reporting melena. 

**Examination Findings:** 

Patient reports a history of melena.  Review of prior diagnostic testing reveals the following:

*   **Endoscopy:** Initial upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a large submucosal tumor in the gastric body, accompanied by a large central ulceration containing residual contrast material from a previous barium study. An endoscopic ultrasound confirmed the large submucosal mass. The initial biopsy result was non-specific, demonstrating acute and chronic inflammation with ulceration. A second biopsy revealed ulceration and tissue granulation with foreign body giant cells suggestive of a barium granuloma.
*   **CT Scan:** The abdominal CT scan demonstrated a 5.5 x 3.2 cm well-defined exophytically growing mass arising from the posterior aspect of the lesser curvature side in the gastric body, with a large ulceration at the gastric luminal side and a cavity communicating with the gastric lumen. No evidence of direct invasion of adjacent organs or peritoneal spread was noted. No metastatic lesions or lymphadenopathy were identified in the abdomen or pelvis. The mass showed relative hypoattenuation on precontrast images and increased heterogeneous enhancement in the portal and equilibrium phases, prompting consideration of a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

**Procedure:** Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach performed under general anesthesia. During laparotomy, a round and well-demarcated mass measuring 5.4 x 5.2 x 4 cm was identified arising from the lesser curvature side of the gastric body, surrounded by prominent vessels and without any adhesions to adjacent structures. No ascites was present.

**Pathology:** The specimen consisted of a portion of the stomach measuring 8.5 x 5 cm with an attached ovoid and lobulated rubbery to firm solid mass. The mucosa was retracted by the underlying mass. 

**Plan:** Patient to follow up in two weeks to discuss next steps.
