**Subject:** Chronic Hip Pain and Periprosthetic Issues

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reports a significant history of chronic hip pain and periprosthetic complications related to previous bilateral total hip arthroplasties.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Bilateral total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed in 1995 utilizing Biomet Bi-Metric stem and Ringloc cup through a posterior approach.
*   Prior debilitating bilateral hip pain and a difference in leg length.
*   Developed a draining sinus tract of the left thigh and bilateral periprosthetic infections (not confirmed with aspiration) following the initial THAs. 

**Timeline of Events:**
*   **1995:** Bilateral THAs performed.
*   **2004:** First clinic visit. Patient reported doing well with no hip pain, but noted decreased hip range of motion and heterotopic ossification around both hips on X-ray.  Patient was also experiencing drainage from the sinus tract of the left thigh.
*   **2004-2005:** Patient was taking amoxicillin for the periprosthetic infections.
*   **2005:** Patient initiated weaning from amoxicillin due to cessation of drainage from the sinus tract.
