**Patient Name:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing in Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing in Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Post-Procedure Follow-Up - Transient Ischemic Attack & Atrial Fibrillation

**History:** Patient is a [Patient Age - *Information Missing in Dialogue*] year old male admitted three days prior for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and new onset atrial fibrillation.

**Hospital Course:** Patient underwent an attempted pacemaker placement due to sinus bradycardia. Following placement of a five French sheath, arterial blood return was noted, leading to procedure termination. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to our institution for vascular surgery consultation. Upon arrival, the patient was intubated and sedated with the five French sheath in place in the left chest, covered with a dressing and a left chest tube in place with 100cc of sanguinous output. The patient was then taken to the hybrid operating room. 

**Procedure:** During the procedure, two ProGlide devices were placed in the left access utilizing a standard preclose technique. An ascending aorta pigtail catheter was advanced, and an arch aortogram was performed, demonstrating direct cannulation of the aortic knob. Due to the patient’s comorbidities and advanced age, stent graft placement was elected to manage the arterial injury. 

**Preoperative Assessment:** A cerebral angiogram was performed to identify cerebrovascular dominance, revealing a dominant right vertebral artery and left vertebral atresia. Adequate distance was maintained from the site of sheath insertion to the left subclavian artery, allowing for successful seal placement without covering the artery. Preoperative measurement of anticipated proximal and distal seal zones confirmed successful procedure. 

**Current Status:** Patient is currently stable. Follow-up appointment scheduled for [Date - *Information Missing in Dialogue*] to assess progress.
