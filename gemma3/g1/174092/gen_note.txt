**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Right Inguinal Hernia with Appendix

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presented to the outpatient surgical setting with a 6-week history of a right groin bulge.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reported the development of a right inguinal bulge approximately 6 weeks ago. Initially associated with sharp pain, the patient is currently asymptomatic.

**Physical Examination:** Physical examination revealed a 3 cm × 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Studies:**
*   Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.
*   Preoperative laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 4.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.

**Procedure:**
*   Classic oblique incision in the right groin was performed using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.
*   The hernia was examined and found to be comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance. 
*   A relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered to facilitate reduction of the appendix.

**Findings:** The appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction. 

**Postoperative Course:** No complications were encountered during the procedure. 

**Recommendations:** Patient to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks postoperatively. Follow-up appointment scheduled to monitor recovery.
