**Patient Name:** [Patient Name - Assumed]
**Date:** [Today’s Date]
**Subject:** Kyphotic Scoliosis – Follow-Up

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient is a 17-year-old male presenting today with a longstanding history of severe back pain, primarily localized to the thoracolumbar junction. The pain significantly impacts his activities.

**Past Medical History:**

*   The patient reports being overweight with a BMI of 37.
*   He has no reported spinal infections, injuries, skeletal dysplasias, or other medical co-morbidities.
*   He was previously followed by a spinal unit since the age of 16 due to a gradually progressing kyphosis which became symptomatic.

**Examination Findings:**

*   Sharp angular kyphosis of 105° with the apex in the thoracolumbar junction.
*   Bilateral hamstring tightness.
*   Thoracolumbar scoliosis measuring 30°.
*   Normal neurological examination.
*   No evidence of spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis.

**Imaging:**

*   Lateral radiograph of spine revealed bridging osteophytes anteriorly across the apex of the kyphosis.
*   MRI of spine (performed at age 16) showed spinal cord attenuation across the thoracolumbar junction but no cord signal change, no disc herniation and no intraspinal anomalies. Bridging osteophytes were not present on the MRI. No evidence of fusion of the posterior elements across the levels of the kyphosis, congenital vertebral abnormalities, or intraspinal anomalies were noted.
*   Previous kyphosis correction was performed at age 17 years and 11 months old, with a final deformity of 115°, which corrected to 100° on a supine hyperextension radiograph against the bolster.

**Assessment:**

The patient presents with a severe kyphotic scoliosis and significant back pain, refractory to conservative measures. The extreme degree of deformity and the risk for further progression that could potentially cause neurological complications warrant consideration for further intervention.

**Plan:**

Schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks. Advise the patient to continue to monitor symptoms and report any changes.
