**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Not provided in dialogue]
**Date:** [Date of Note - Not Provided]
**Subject:** Aneurysmal Swelling â€“ Infant

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient is a 6-month-old male presenting for follow-up regarding a previously noted aneurysmal swelling. The swelling was initially identified by the parents approximately 2 months prior, located on the hypothenar eminence of the left hand. The swelling was gradually increasing in size and was initially painless. The parents reported that the baby had a habit of hitting his left hand on objects, primarily while eating.

**Examination:**

On examination, the swelling was palpable and pulsatile on palpation. There were no motor deficits in the left hand.

**Diagnosis:**

Confirmed aneurysmal swelling, most likely arising from the ulnar artery or the palmar arch due to its location.

**Treatment:**

Given the patient's age and financial limitations, surgical excision was elected.

**Procedure:**

Intraoperatively, the aneurysm was identified as involving the ulnar artery from below the wrist and distal forearm, extending to the superficial palmar arch. It was associated with the digital blood supply of the little finger and ring finger. The aneurysm was excised and repaired with an interposition reverse cephalic vein graft from the distal forearm of the same side. The proximal end of the reverse cephalic vein was anastomosed to the distal end of the ulnar artery, and the two distal ends of the reverse cephalic vein were anastomosed in a Y-shape fashion, one at the superficial palmar arch.

**Follow-up:**

No further investigations were performed.
