**Subject:** Evaluation of Wound Dehiscence and Hardware Exposure – Left Knee

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents to our department today for evaluation of wound dehiscence and hardware exposure on the left knee. The patient reports persistent pain associated with the wound.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a history of a previous total left hip arthroplasty performed at age 74 due to severe osteoarthritis pain. Eight years post-op, she presented to the orthopedics department with progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly during ambulation, leading to difficulties in deambulation. X-ray examination revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. 

Subsequent to this, the patient experienced symptoms of infection approximately three weeks post-revision total hip arthroplasty. These symptoms included high fever, suppuration, non-healing wound, and laboratory abnormalities. Conservative management, including intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainage, was unsuccessful, necessitating a staged revision of the endoprosthesis. 

**Revision Procedures:** 

*   **Stage 1:** Removal of the previous prosthesis with enlarged osteotomy of the anterior tuberosity and placement of a cement spacer with antibiotic.
*   **Stage 2:** Removal of the cement spacer two months later, followed by placement of a coated silver total femoral prosthesis. 

**Current Presentation:**

The patient was referred to our unit four weeks post-Stage 2 revision for assessment of wound dehiscence to the lateral knee with hardware exposure. A retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap was performed. Initial consideration of a lateral gastrocnemius flap was deemed unsuitable due to significant scarring and atrophic muscle. A free flap was ultimately selected, however, the descending genicular artery demonstrated small caliber and calcified plaques, necessitating dissection. 

**Assessment:** Wound dehiscence and hardware exposure with free flap.
