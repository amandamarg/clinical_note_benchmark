**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Assuming Patient Name is provided]
**Date:** [Date of Note]
**Subject:** Evaluation of Left Leg Pain and Swelling

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presented today with pain and swelling in his left leg, which began approximately one month ago without any specific trauma. He reports erythematous changes on the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. 

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a significant past medical history, including a long-standing diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. 

**Past Surgical History:**

The patient has a complex surgical history including:

*   **18 years prior:** Tibial plateau fracture with open reduction and internal fixation. Concurrent sciatic nerve injury.
*   **8 years prior:** Distal femur fracture with femoral artery rupture, open reduction and internal fixation, and stent insertion in the femoral artery.

**Neurological Examination:**

The patient reports limited ankle motion – ankle dorsiflexion 0 degrees and ankle plantar flexion 5 degrees. He also reports clawing deformity of all toes. Neurological examination revealed absent sensation in the first web space and medial aspect of the foot, with sensory reduction in the lateral, dorsal, and plantar aspects of the foot, in order of decreasing sensation. Motor strength was noted as dorsiflexion grade 0 and plantar flexion grade 3. 

**Physical Examination Findings:**

Upon examination, a draining sinus developed spontaneously on the erythematous mass, discharging a thick, chalk-like fluid through the shiny skin. 

**Radiological Findings:**

Radiographs taken during admission revealed a widespread radiopaque mass on the left leg. Previous radiographs taken 10 years ago also showed a mass that had developed over time. Angiography revealed obstruction of the popliteal artery with abundant collateral circulation.

**Assessment:**

Given the history of a long-standing radiopaque mass on the left leg, obstruction of the popliteal artery, and abundant collateral circulation, the prognosis is unfortunately not favorable. 

**Family Communication:**

The family was notified of the patient’s passing.
