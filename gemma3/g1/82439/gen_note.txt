## Clinical Note

**Patient:** Mrs. X
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Physician:** Dr. Y

**Subjective:**

Patient reports a concern regarding her overall health. She presents with a two-month history of weight loss (4 kg), edema progressing to anasarca, and constant lumbar pain. She denies any other significant symptoms.

**Objective:**

*   **Physical Exam:** Completely normal physical examination with no clinical signs suggestive of hypercortisolism.
*   **Medical History:** Patient reports current medication of losartan and amlodipine for controlled hypertension.
*   **Diagnostic Studies:**
    *   Abdominal Tomography revealed a right adrenal gland nodule measuring 14x9 mm and a left adrenal gland nodule measuring 23x18 mm. Multiple vertebral fractures were also noted.
    *   Low dose suppression test with dexamethasone revealed an abnormal cortisol value.
    *   Potassium levels were low.

**Assessment:**

Suspected ACTH-independent form of hypercortisolism, likely secondary to adrenal adenomas. Two adrenal gland nodules >10 mm were identified on imaging.

**Plan:**

The patient will undergo adrenal venous sampling to determine the origin of cortisol production. This will involve radiographic documentation of catheter placement and monitoring of aldosterone levels for correction of dilution between the adrenal veins. The study will be performed using a modified protocol, omitting plasma catecholamine measurement due to lack of immediate availability. 

**Follow-up:** 

Patient to return for scheduled adrenal venous sampling next week. Patient instructed to report any new symptoms or changes in her health.
