**Social History:** Patient is a laborer.

**Examination Findings:** Patient reports feeling comfortable with the newly placed indwelling pleural catheter (ICD). 

**Procedure:** Indwelling pleural catheter (18 Fr Rhemsons) was successfully placed via an ultrasound-guided approach in the mid-axillary line. Skin preparation included application of betadine and methylated spirit followed by local anesthesia with lignocaine 2% at the insertion site and subcutaneously. The ICD was secured with two sutures at the insertion site and a second point. The rear end of the tube was utilized as an air-tight cap after reversing the tube.  A newer economical technique, an indwelling pleural catheter, was employed to avoid hampering motility. 

**Plan:** Patient instructed on care of the ICD. Patient can now move around without carrying the ICD bag. Patient was informed to return immediately if any problems arise.
