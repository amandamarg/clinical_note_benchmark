**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name – *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date – *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Follow-Up – Lower Limb Reconstruction

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reports a history of a lower limb injury sustained in a road traffic accident five years prior, resulting in a below-knee amputation.

**Past Medical History:**  History of below-knee amputation following a road traffic accident five years prior.

**Current Status:** Patient presents for follow-up.

**Pertinent History:**
*   Initial amputation resulted in secondary intention healing due to insufficient soft tissue cover and infection.
*   Patient was fitted with a prosthesis which repeatedly broke down due to sensitivity and pain in the loading area, rendering it unusable.
*   Bone length was maintained at 12 cm below the tibial plateau, requiring shortening of the stump for adequate soft tissue coverage.

**Procedure:** Anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction was performed with vastus lateralis muscle harvested from the opposite side. The scar tissue was excised completely until the bone, and approximately 2cm of the tibial end projected in the wound. Anastomosis was performed end-to-end to popliteal vessels with minimal vessel diameter discrepancy. 

**Operative Details:**
*   Procedure Duration: 6 hours.
*   Recipient Vessel Dissection: Supine position.
*   Donor Site: Satisfactory healing of the skin graft at the donor site.

**Postoperative Course:** Postoperative period was uneventful. Patient was discharged on the 16th postoperative day. Refit with prosthesis occurred 10 weeks post-operatively.

**Current Status (at 20 months post-op):** Patient reports symptom-free status with approximately 70 hours of prosthetic use per week. The flap demonstrates no atrophy or redundancy.  Patient reports improved mobility, able to stand for 5 hours without pain and has increased walking distance from 0.5 miles preoperatively to 2 miles post-operatively.

**Plan:** Follow-up appointment scheduled in a few months.
