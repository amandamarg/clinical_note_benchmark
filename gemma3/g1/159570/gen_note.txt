**Subject:** Chronic Pain and Periodontal Involvement â€“ Upper Left Canine Tooth

**History of Present Illness:**

Patient reports chronic throbbing pain in the upper left canine tooth, onset approximately one year ago following orthognathic surgery on the upper maxilla. Patient initially presented with occasional pain, and now reports a painful periodontal abscess with a draining sinus opening in relation to the periapex of the same tooth. 

**Examination Findings:**

*   Pain elicited on vertical and lateral percussion of the upper left canine tooth.
*   Periodontal pocket of 9mm probing depth in the distal area of the tooth.
*   Radiograph reveals a root injury in the middle third of the root with evidence of fast resorption of the root area in the border of the lesion with an ample alveolar bone loss surrounding it.


**Treatment Plan:**

Patient was previously treated for root canal therapy for the management of pain. However, a periodontal review was not completed. Now, six months later, patient presents with an active periodontal abscess. 

Proposed treatment includes: Modified Widman flap surgery along with restoration of the root lesion with glassionomer cement. To control the inflammatory status of the gingiva and to drain the abscess for a firm and less hemorrhagic area for operation, a closed curettage of the pocket followed by subgingival irrigation will be performed. 

**Discussion:**

Patient acknowledges the possibility of treatment failure following root fracture and the recurrence of the pocket following non-adaptation of the gingival tissue on the restorative surface. 

**Patient Understanding:** Patient understands the proposed treatment plan and the potential risks associated with the treatment. 

**Next Steps:** Procedure scheduled for [Date/Time - To be filled in].
