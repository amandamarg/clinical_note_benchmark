They are **extremely similar**, almost identical in content and detail. Here's a breakdown of the key similarities:\n\n**1. Core Patient History:**\n\n*   **Diagnosis:** Both notes definitively establish a diagnosis of osteomalacia.\n*   **Onset & Progression:** Both describe the onset of the condition in early childhood (around 2.5 years old), the inability to walk, the progression of weakness and pain, and the eventual bedridden state.\n*   **Specific Symptoms:** Both detail the same specific symptoms: difficulty walking, bone pain, weakness (particularly impacting mobility), difficulty with activities like turning over in bed, and pain during pregnancy.\n*   **Physical Examination Findings:** Both note the patient's height (144 cm) and weight (49 kg) and the observation that she was shorter than her family members. Both also include the observation of bowing of the legs and genu valgus.\n*   **Neurological Findings:** Both include the normal nerve conduction study and the neurologist's conclusion of no neurological disease.\n*   **Treatment History:** Both note the previous attempts with calcitriol and the lack of improvement.\n\n**2.  Detailed Narrative:**\n\n*   The wording, phrasing, and specific details within the narratives are almost identical.  This includes the descriptions of her family circumstances, the pregnancy-related complications, and the consultations with different specialists.\n\n**3.  Temporal Context:**\n\n*   Both notes cover the period from the onset of the condition to the time of the note's creation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBecause of the nearly identical content, the notes are **very highly similar**. The only minor difference is the date of the presentation \u2013 one is the initial presentation, and the other is a later encounter.  They essentially describe the same patient's history and condition.\n\nDo you want me to analyze any specific aspects of the notes more closely, or perhaps compare them in terms of a particular clinical element (e.g., the physician's plan)?"}}
