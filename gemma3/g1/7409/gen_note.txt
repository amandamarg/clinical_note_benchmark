**Date:** [Date - Not Provided]
**Subject:** Aortic Dissection

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented today for follow-up regarding a recent aortic dissection. Patient was admitted to the hospital two weeks prior with complaints of chest and back pain. 

**Examination:** Physical examination revealed stable vital signs and the patient was conscious and able to move all limbs. 

**Diagnostic Findings:** Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap originating from the origin of the left subclavian artery with an enlargement of the false lumen containing a mural thrombus and compression of the true lumen. A large entry point was noted 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the trachea. The left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. No other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion was identified below the level of the renal arteries.

**Intervention:** Patient underwent a thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) procedure via the right femoral approach. An angiogram was performed intraoperatively. A stent graft (34 mm × 15 cm) was deployed into the descending thoracic aorta. The intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. 

**Post-Procedure:** Post-deployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries, as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries. Patient was able to move all limbs and peripheral pulses were intact. 

**Discharge:** Patient was discharged one day after the surgery and reported doing well. Prognosis is being closely monitored.
