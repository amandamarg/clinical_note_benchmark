They are *extremely* similar, representing essentially the same clinical scenario. Here's a breakdown of the key similarities and why they're so close:\n\n**1. Core Clinical Picture:**\n\n* **Diagnosis:** Both notes describe a patient presenting with an aortic dissection, specifically originating from the left subclavian artery.\n* **Symptoms:** Both patients initially presented with chest and back pain.\n* **Initial Findings:**  The initial physical exam and CT angiography (CTA) findings are almost identical. They both reveal:\n    * Large dissection flap at the origin of the left subclavian artery.\n    * Enlarged false lumen with a mural thrombus.\n    * Compression of the true lumen.\n    * Entry point 2cm distal to the right subclavian artery.\n    * Aberrant right subclavian artery crossing posterior to the trachea.\n    * Left vertebral artery arising directly from the aortic arch.\n    * No other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the renal arteries.\n\n**2. Intervention and Outcome:**\n\n* **Treatment:** Both patients underwent a thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) procedure via the right femoral approach.\n* **Stent Graft Size:** The stent graft size deployed is identical (34mm x 15cm).\n* **Post-Procedure Findings:** The post-deployment angiograms are nearly identical, demonstrating successful occlusion of the entry point, good flow through the arteries, and intact peripheral pulses.\n* **Discharge:** Both patients were discharged one day after surgery, reporting well, and with a monitored prognosis.\n\n**3. Language and Style:**\n\n* The notes use similar medical terminology and phrasing.\n* They have a similar level of detail regarding the examination findings and intervention.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI'd rate the similarity between these two notes as **95%**. The differences are minor variations in phrasing, slightly different descriptions of the patient's background (one is Pakistani, one is not explicitly stated), and minor differences in the clinical details recorded.  \n\n**In essence, these notes are describing the exact same surgical procedure and outcome for a patient with a complex aortic dissection.**\n\nDo you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of the similarity, such as:\n\n*   The specific differences in phrasing?\n*   How these notes might be used in a medical record comparison?"}}
