Text 1 is more condensed.\n*   **Wound Detail:** Text 2 gives a more precise description of the wound size and location (\"1.5 cm x 1 cm\" vs. \"1.5 cm x 1 cm\").\n*   **Wound Extension:** Text 2 is more explicit about the wound being extended distally and medially for adequate exposure.\n*   **Specific Wound Closure:** Text 2 describes the wound closure as \"in layers\" and the use of a bulky dressing and below knee POP splint.\n*   **Post-operative Management:** Text 2 provides significantly more detail on the post-operative care, including the use of a walking cast boot with toe-touch weight bearing, the length of time the patient was kept non-weight bearing, and the progression of weight-bearing and exercises.\n*   **Follow-up:** Text 2 describes a much more structured and extended follow-up schedule (monthly for 6 months, then 3 monthly, and 12/18 months).\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI\u2019d estimate a **very high similarity** \u2013 probably around **85-90%**. The core clinical picture and the interventions are virtually identical. The differences primarily lie in the level of detail and the extended timeframe/follow-up provided in Text 2.\n\nDo you want me to delve deeper into any particular aspect of the comparison, such as the specific surgical techniques or the follow-up protocol?"}}
