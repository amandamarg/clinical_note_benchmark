**Subject:** Right Foot Dorsal MTP Joint Dislocation

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents with a right foot injury secondary to a road traffic accident. 

**Examination Findings:** Upon examination, the patient exhibited significant swelling and a wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot. Radiographs revealed a dorsal dislocation of the first and second MTP joints with dorsal displacement of the sesamoid complex. 

**Intervention:** Initial attempts at closed reduction were unsuccessful. Subsequent reduction attempts under spinal anesthesia in the emergency OT approximately 12 hours post-injury were also unsuccessful. During the second attempt, the plantar wound was extended 1.5 cm distally and medially for adequate exposure. The head of the first metatarsal was found to be protruding plantarwards through a rent in the plantar fascia with intact collateral ligaments. The lateral collateral ligament was divided, a lever was placed dorsal to the proximal phalanx, and longitudinal traction and dorsal push was applied to the head of the metatarsal to achieve reduction of the 1st MTP joint. The sesamoid complex followed the proximal phalanx but the 2nd MTP joint remained unreduced after an attempt at closed reduction. A lever was applied dorsal to the head of the 2nd metatarsal along with longitudinal traction through the same wound to facilitate its leverage out of deep transverse metatarsal ligament lying dorsal. 

**Treatment Plan:**
*   Rest and elevation of the right foot.
*   Ice application to reduce swelling.
*   Pain medication as prescribed.

**Follow-up:** Patient to monitor for any changes and report back if any concerns arise.
