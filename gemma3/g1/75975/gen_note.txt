**Subject:** Ectopic Canine & Buccal Expansion â€“ Case Review

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient was referred by their orthodontist for evaluation of an ectopic upper left canine and associated buccal expansion. Patient reports no current symptoms.

**Examination Findings:**

*   Initial examination revealed firm, bony expansion between teeth 22 and 24. The overlying mucosa was normal. Teeth 22 and 24 were not mobile.
*   **Radiographic Findings:** Initial radiographic examination revealed an ectopic 23 tooth. A possible large cystic radiolucency was noted surrounding the canine. No evidence of root resorption of teeth 22 and 24.
*   **CT Scan Findings:** Cone beam CT demonstrated expanded bone in the 23 region with normal trabecular pattern and intact buccal and palatal cortices. However, there was buccal cortical expansion. The 23 was located in the zygomatic bone, with the crown facing buccally and causing dehiscence of the zygomatic bone. The roots were facing toward the left maxillary sinus with a dilacerated apex projecting into the sinus.
*   **Exploratory Findings:** Examination of the left maxillary sinus revealed the 23 was not visible. The expanded buccal bone appeared firm but abnormal looking with slight bleeding.

**Diagnosis:**  Imaging and exploratory findings are consistent with an impacted/idiopathic hyperplastic (IH) lesion. The exact cause of the buccal alveolar expansion and migration of the 23 is currently unclear.

**Plan:**

*   Follow-up appointment scheduled in a few months to monitor the condition.
*   Patient to return immediately if any symptoms develop. 

**Note:** Minimal evidence of resorption was noted on histopathology. The soft tissue component was a mixture of adipose and highly vascular fibrous tissue with numerous blood vessels displacing adipose tissue.
