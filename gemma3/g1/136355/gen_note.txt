**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Post-Operative Burn Wound Repair – Ventral Hernia Repair

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presented with 40% acute flame burns to the neck, chest, anterior abdominal wall, and upper limbs. 

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a significant past medical history including multiple abdominal surgeries related to tuberculosis ten years prior. This included an exploratory laparotomy with burst abdomen and temporary colostomy, followed by a ventral hernia repair five years later which became infected and necessitated removal.

**Procedure:** Today, the patient underwent surgical repair of a Type 2 abdominal wall defect following the burn injuries. The procedure involved harvesting a fascia lata graft (18 cm x 10 cm) from the left thigh and utilizing it to close the 20 cm x 12 cm defect in the lower two-thirds of the midline of the abdomen.  Additionally, an islanded TFL myocutaneous flap (30 cm x 10 cm) was harvested from the right thigh, turned 120 degrees, and applied to the abdominal defect in the right iliac region, incorporating a bridging segment. The edges of the defect were meticulously excised, and the fascia was reinforced to the inside wall edge. A closed suction drain was placed. 

**Post-operative Course:** The postoperative period has been uneventful. The closed suction drain was removed. 

**Discussion:** The patient is currently doing well. 

**Plan:** Continue to monitor closely.
