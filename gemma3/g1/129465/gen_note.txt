**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name – *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date – *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) & Pancreatic Fibrosis

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents for follow-up following surgical intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic fibrosis.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Hypertension
*   Type 2 Diabetes
*   History of Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer (treated 7 years ago) – Including:
    *   Lumpectomy of Left Breast and Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
    *   Radiation Therapy (7 cycles)
    *   Adjuvant Chemotherapy (Anastrozole – 5 years)

**Relevant Findings:**

Patient reports a history of regular annual CT scans following breast cancer treatment, revealing:
*   7 years post-treatment, CT scan revealed a 7 cm solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII.
*   A 1 cm calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas.

**Symptoms:**
*   Mild tenderness on palpation of the right subcostal region.

**Laboratory Findings:**
*   Tumor markers (AFP, CA 15–3, CA 19–9, CEA) were within normal limits.
*   Biochemical markers of liver and pancreatic function were normal.

**Diagnostic Procedures:**
*   Oncologic consultation was performed.
*   Lesions were deemed resectable with initial discussion of metastatic vs. second primary malignancy.
*   CT-guided percutaneous biopsies and laparoscopic biopsies were declined due to risk of complications.
*   Patient opted for laparotomy with rapid biopsy and excision of lesions in one procedure.
*   Extended right subcostal incision allowed for hepatic mobilization and exposure of the right hepatic lobe.
*   Rapid biopsy of the hepatic segments VI and VII confirmed primary HCC.
*   Rapid biopsy from the pancreatic tail demonstrated chronic fibrosis without malignancy.
*   Hepatic segments VI and VII were resected due to intraoperative hepatic ultrasound confirming resectability with safe oncologic margins.

**Plan:**
Patient to return for follow-up in a few weeks to assess healing and monitor for any further issues.
