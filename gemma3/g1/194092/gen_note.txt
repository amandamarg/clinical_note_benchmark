**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Right Inguinal Hernia with Appendix

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presented with a right groin bulge noted 6 weeks prior.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reported the development of a right inguinal bulge approximately 6 weeks ago. Initially associated with sharp pain at the time of development, but has since been asymptomatic.

**Physical Exam:** Examination revealed a 3 cm x 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin, lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Testing:**
*   Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.
*   Preoperative laboratory testing showed a white blood cell count of 4.7 x 10^9/L.

**Procedure:**
*   Classic oblique incision in the right groin, utilizing the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks.
*   Examination revealed a hernia comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance.
*   A relaxing incision was made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered to reduce the appendix.

**Findings:** The appendix was noted exiting the internal inguinal ring, however, the densely adhered omentum prevented successful reduction back into the peritoneal cavity.

**Complications:** None.

**Post-operative Instructions:** Patient advised to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks. Follow-up appointment scheduled for recovery monitoring.
