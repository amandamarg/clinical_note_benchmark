They share nearly identical details about the patient\u2019s presentation, physical exam findings, diagnostic imaging, surgical procedure, and outcomes.\n\n**Specific Similarities (Highlighted):**\n\n*   **Patient Presentation:** Both notes begin with a patient presenting with a right groin bulge of 6 weeks duration with initial pain and subsequent asymptomatic period.\n*   **Physical Exam:** Both note a 3 cm x 3 cm firm, nontender mass lateral to the pubic tubercle.\n*   **Diagnostic Imaging:** Both report a CT scan revealing a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.  The CT images are referenced in both.\n*   **White Blood Cell Count:** Both documents state a preoperative WBC count of 4.7 x 10^9/L.\n*   **Surgical Procedure:**  Both describe a classic oblique incision using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle, and the use of a relaxing incision through the rectus sheath to reduce the appendix.\n*   **Key Findings:** Both describe the hernia being comprised of a dense, scarred omentum with the appendix exiting the internal inguinal ring.\n*   **Outcome:** Both note the inability to reduce the appendix due to the adherent omentum, necessitating an appendectomy.\n*   **Post-operative Instructions/Follow-up:** Both document the patient\u2019s discharge and a follow-up appointment.\n*   **Pathological Findings:** Both report the presence of fat necrosis around the appendix.\n\n**Key Differences (Minor):**\n\n*   Text 2 provides more detailed information about the patient\u2019s history (the original repair in 1977) and the specific surgical steps taken (e.g., the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler).\n*   Text 2 includes a more narrative account of the surgical procedure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe notes are nearly identical, strongly suggesting they both document the same clinical case. The differences are primarily in the level of detail provided. It\u2019s highly probable they originate from the same medical record."}}
