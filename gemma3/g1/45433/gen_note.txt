**Subjective:**

Patient reports a longstanding history of depression and anxiety spanning 20 years. Patient states they have experienced multiple episodes of moderate to severe depression, including two prior suicide attempts resulting in inpatient psychiatric unit admissions. 

During a recent admission, treatment consisted of Lamotrigine 25mg daily, gradually increased to 50mg twice daily over two weeks, in combination with Sertaline 150mg daily and Buspirone 5mg twice daily. This combination led to significant improvement in anxiety and depressive symptoms, with the patient feeling “almost back to my normal self.”

Following discharge, the patient continued on the same regimen. Approximately 16 days post-discharge, the patient developed conjunctivitis, facial swelling, lip swelling, erosion of the mucous membrane inside the mouth, erythematous papules and bullous eruptions primarily on the palms and soles of their feet with detachment of the epidermis.  The patient was subsequently referred to the general hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to deteriorating physical symptoms.
