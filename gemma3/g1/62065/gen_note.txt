**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Date:** [Date - *Information Missing from Dialogue*]
**Subject:** Persistent Regurgitation and Watery Diarrhea

**History of Present Illness:**

The patient presents today with a longstanding history of regurgitation of food and watery diarrhea, initially noted four years ago. The regurgitation occurs within 5-25 minutes post-meal and lasts up to 2 hours. This has significantly impacted the patient’s daily life, social activities, and ability to maintain employment. The patient reports approximately ten episodes of watery diarrhea per day.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a significant history of asthma and anxiety. 

**Prior Evaluations and Treatments:**

The patient reports a complex and frustrating diagnostic journey. Previous evaluations included investigations for right upper quadrant abdominal pain with vomiting, revealing biliary sludge and a HIDA scan with an ejection fraction of < 20%.  A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in March 2010 based on this assumption, but symptoms persisted. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic gastroparesis, evidenced by isotope regurgitation findings on upper endoscopy. Medical therapy for gastroparesis was attempted, including a gastric stimulator placed in October 2010, providing only a marginal improvement (<10%).  A pyloroplasty was performed in January 2011, initially improving symptoms for 2-3 weeks, but they subsequently recurred and were associated with watery diarrhea. 

**Current Nutritional Status:**

The patient remains severely malnourished and is currently maintained on nocturnal jejunal tube feedings.

**Plan:**

Ordered diagnostic tests to further evaluate the etiology of the patient’s symptoms. Prescribed medication to manage symptoms.

**Follow-up:**  Scheduled follow-up appointment in two weeks.
