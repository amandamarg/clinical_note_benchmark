**Subject:** Chronic Femur Fracture Management

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents with persistent thigh pain following multiple prior femur fractures.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of a femur fracture in the supracondylar region, sustained 3 months prior. This was initially treated with a dynamic condylar screw assembly and required subsequent supervised physiotherapy.

**Current Findings:** Patient reports continued thigh pain following prior fractures. Radiographs revealed a fracture above the dynamic condylar screw at the plate bone interface. Following this, a revision surgery with a longer barrel plate was performed. Four months post-revision, pain was reported in the peri-implant area, and subsequent radiographs revealed a fracture of the femur at the new peri-implant region. The femoral neck radiograph revealed an osteoporosis grading of 3 according to Singh’s classification.

**Intervention:** Due to potential morbidity associated with repeat plating, a less invasive approach was chosen. The screws in the plate were removed percutaneously under image intensifier control to ensure patency of the intramedullary canal, leaving the plate *in situ*. The fracture was then reduced and fixed with a reamed antegrade intramedullary nail. An external locking device comprising of a distal full ring and a proximal Italian arch connected by two threaded rods was utilized for distal locking. No blood transfusion or bone grafting was required. The operating time was 40 minutes.

**Post-Operative Course:** Patient was ambulated on the first postoperative day and discharged with instructions for range of motion exercises of the knee and advised to compress the fracture at a rate of 1 mm per day in divided increments.

**Plan:** Follow-up appointment scheduled.
