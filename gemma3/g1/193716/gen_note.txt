**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - Assuming Patient Name is not provided]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Subject:** Chronic Abdominal Wound & Subphrenic Collection

**History of Presenting Illness:** 
The patient presents today with a discharging wound in the upper abdomen, which has been ongoing for approximately one month. The patient reports this issue began six months ago following an emergency exploratory laparotomy at another medical college for a small peptic perforation, which was repaired with an omental patch. Following the initial surgery, a burst abdomen occurred on the fourth post-operative day and was managed conservatively. The patient was subsequently discharged and initially doing well at home, however, the abdominal wound was not healing.

**Physical Exam:**
On examination, a 12 cm x 5 cm elliptical skin graft is noted over the middle abdomen. An approximately 1 cm x 1 cm depressed ulcer is present in the upper portion of the graft, covered with pale granulation tissue and exhibiting serous oozing. Several other areas demonstrate exuberant pale granulation tissue. The patient reports discomfort in this area. Palpation reveals a deficient abdominal wall below the skin graft.

**Review of Systems:**
Patient reports discomfort in the area of the skin graft.

**Relevant Laboratory Findings:**
*   Hemoglobin: 11.4 gm/dl
*   Total WBC Count: 11.6 x 103/mm3
*   Total Serum Protein: 7.9 gm/dl
*   Serum Albumin: 3.5 gm/dl

**Imaging:**
*   Ultrasound: Left subphrenic collection measuring 8 cm x 7 cm.

**Plan:**
Due to the persistent nature of the wound and the presence of the subphrenic collection, further investigation is warranted. Recommendations include:
*   Scheduling a follow-up appointment.
*   Consideration of CT scan to further evaluate the area and identify any missed pathology.
*   Consultation with a wound care specialist.

**Family Informed:** Yes
