Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key similarities and why they\u2019re so close:\n\n**1. Core Patient Information:**\n\n*   **Patient Profile:** Both notes describe a 78-year-old Caucasian male.\n*   **Initial Presentation:** Both detail the same initial presentation \u2013 swelling of the right leg, a pulmonary embolus, and loss of sensation in the right foot.\n*   **Timeline:** The notes share the same chronological progression: initial admission, VQ scan, anticoagulation, eventual diagnosis, and surgical interventions.\n\n**2. Diagnostic Findings:**\n\n*   **Pulmonary Embolus:** Both confirm the initial diagnosis of a pulmonary embolus.\n*   **Right Leg Swelling & Aneurysm:**  Crucially, both note the discovery of a right popliteal aneurysm with a diameter of 12 cm, initially suspected as a pseudoaneurysm due to peripheral calcification.\n*   **Iliac Veins:** Both mention ectatic iliacs and an abdominal aorta diameter of 3.4 cm.\n*   **INR:** Both state the patient's INR was 2.6.\n\n**3. Treatment & Intervention:**\n\n*   **Anticoagulation:** Both describe the decision to continue with full anticoagulation (heparin and warfarin) instead of an inferior vena caval filter.\n*   **Surgical Repair:** Both detail the surgical interventions \u2013 repair of the right and left popliteal aneurysms using an inlay PTFE graft.\n*   **Post-operative Care:**  Both describe the packing of the aneurysm sac and its removal after 48 hours under sedation.\n\n**4. Outcome:**\n\n*   **Recovery:**  Both conclude with an \u201cuneventful recovery.\u201d\n\n\n**Differences:**\n\nThe notes aren't identical. There are slight differences in wording and the level of detail, especially regarding the specific imaging techniques (CT arteriogram vs. duplex scan), but these are minor variations. The second note provides more detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the treatment decisions. \n\n**In conclusion, these notes are nearly mirror images of each other, documenting the exact same complex vascular case.**"}}
