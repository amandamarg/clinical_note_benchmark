**Subject:** Complex Pacemaker Lead Management – Recurrent Infection and Lead Extraction

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presented today for follow-up regarding a recurrent infection and complex lead extraction related to their pacemaker. The patient initially presented at their home hospital with a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket.

**Past Medical History:**

*   Dual chamber pacemaker implanted in 1990, replaced in 1998 and 2003.
*   No prior open-heart surgical procedures.

**Hospital Course:**

The patient’s initial presentation at their home hospital was characterized by a swollen and erythematous pacemaker pocket.  Investigations included blood cultures (negative for bacteria or fungus) and a trans-esophageal echocardiogram, which revealed suspicion of an extravascular atrial lead. A subsequent chest computerized tomographic imaging study demonstrated a right atrial lead tip approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space.  The patient was diagnosed with a suspected pacemaker pocket infection and treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Despite this treatment and a pacemaker pocket exploration and debridement, the infection recurred, necessitating transfer to this center for complex lead extraction. 

**Lead Extraction Procedure:**

A combined transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was performed to minimize the risk of vascular disruption and tamponade. The procedure involved a midline sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass support. Intraoperatively, dense adhesions within the pericardial space were discovered, likely due to prior pericarditis. The right atrial dissection was carefully preserved. 

**Final Diagnosis:**

Suspected pacemaker pocket infection with chronic right atrial lead perforation. 

**Plan:**

Continue monitoring for any complications.
