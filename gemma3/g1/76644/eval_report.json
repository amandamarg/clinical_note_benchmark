Text 1 doesn't offer this level of detail.\n* **Diagnostic Framework:** Text 2 explicitly arrives at a final diagnosis of **Parry-Romberg Syndrome** based on the findings. Text 1 only states an \u201cImpression\u201d of chronic atrophy and fibrosis.\n* **Investigations:** Text 2 includes a comprehensive list of investigations:\n    *   OPG (Orthopantomograph) - highlighted key findings of asymmetry, thinning of mandible, and carious teeth.\n    *   Paranasal sinus view \u2013 revealed hypoplasia of frontal and maxillary sinus.\n    *   CT Scan \u2013 more detailed investigation of the underlying structural abnormalities.\n* **Treatment Considerations:** Text 2 discusses treatment options: \u201cDental and reconstructive plastic surgery using autologous fat transplant.\u201d Text 1 simply states a referral to a specialist.\n\n**Overall Similarity Score:**\n\nI\u2019d estimate the two notes share approximately **80-85%** similarity in terms of the underlying clinical presentation and the core mechanism of the condition. However, Text 2 is far more detailed, provides a definitive diagnosis, and includes significantly more information regarding investigations and treatment.\n\nDo you want me to delve into a specific aspect of the comparison, such as the differences in diagnostic terminology or the specifics of the investigations performed?"}}
