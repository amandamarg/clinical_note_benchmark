**Chief Complaint:** Disfigurement of the left side of the face.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presents today complaining of a disfigurement on the left side of the face, which has been present for 14 years. The initial presentation was a small area of hyperpigmentation on the left cheek at age 8. Over time, this progressed to atrophy of the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue, resulting in the current disfigurement. The patient reports limited mouth opening, which has also worsened over time.

**Physical Examination:**
*   **General:** Patient is conscious and oriented. Vital signs are stable.
*   **Facial Examination:** Significant asymmetry noted on the left side of the face. The skin overlying the affected area is flattened, hyperpigmented, and parchment-like. There is an evident loss of underlying fat, muscle, and subcutaneous tissue, resulting in a sunken-in appearance. Thinning of the lips on the affected side with exposure of teeth due to the corner of the mouth being pulled to the left side.
*   **Palpation:** Skin on the affected side is rigid with signs of sclerosis. Tenderness and deviation to the left on mouth opening with TMJ.
*   **Oral Examination:** Normal moist mucosa but tense oral mucosa on the affected side. Marked atrophy of the tongue on the affected side with a shift in the dorsal median fissure. Crowding of teeth with a shift in midline to the affected side and obliteration of buccal and vestibular sulcus due to tense oral tissue. Upper and lower arch showed constriction of the arch with multiple carious teeth.

**Ocular Examination:** No abnormalities noted.

**Skin Examination:** No evidence of lymphadenopathy.

**Impression:**  Patient presents with a chronic facial disfigurement consistent with significant atrophy and fibrosis. 

**Plan:** Referral to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. 

**Follow-up:**  Patient to return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks.
