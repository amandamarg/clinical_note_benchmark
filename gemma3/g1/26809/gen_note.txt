**Subject:** 24-Day-Old Female Infant - Diaphragmatic Hernia Repair

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient is a 24-day-old female infant admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and fever. 

**Examination Findings:**

*   Upon examination, decreased air entry was noted on the left side.
*   Chest radiograph revealed consolidation and air-filled bowel loops within the chest.
*   Ultrasound examination identified an intrathoracic ipsilateral kidney.
*   A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a left-sided diaphragmatic defect with large and small bowel and a completely intrathoracic, ipsilateral left kidney and adrenal gland.

**Procedure:**

*   Diaphragmatic hernia repair was performed in left lateral decubitus position.
*   A 5 mm camera port was inserted via an anterior axillary approach, with two 3 mm working ports inserted under vision on either side of the camera port.
*   The herniated large and small bowel was pushed and reduced into the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect, revealing a completely intrathoracic kidney encased in Gerotaâ€™s fascia. The kidney was then retroperitoneally reduced through the diaphragmatic defect.
*   A primary repair utilizing interrupted nonabsorbable sutures was achieved without tension.
*   Gas pressure was initially maintained at 6 mm Hg during hernia contents reduction and subsequently reduced to 4 mm Hg during defect closure.
*   A chest drain was placed in situ through the 5 mm port site due to pleural violation. 

**Postoperative Course:**

*   The baby had an uneventful recovery and was extubated within 24 hours.
*   The chest drain was removed after 48 hours.
*   A renal ultrasound scan performed 3 years postoperatively demonstrated well and equally perfused kidneys with comparable renal volumes bilaterally without any evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, or recurrence.

**Discharge:**

*   Discharged on day 5 postoperatively and is being followed up as an outpatient.

**Note:** Renal ultrasound scan done 3 years postoperatively showed well and equally perfused kidneys with comparable renal volumes bilaterally without any evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter, or recurrence.
