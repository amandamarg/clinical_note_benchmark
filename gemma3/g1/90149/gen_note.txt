## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *Please Insert Patient Name Here*]
**Date:** [Date - *Please Insert Date Here*]
**Subject:** Surgical Excision of Right Atrium Lipoma & Lung Biopsy

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today for surgical evaluation and excision of a right atrium lipoma, following initial findings of a suspicious shadow on a recent chest X-ray. 

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a significant past medical history including a diagnosis of malignant melanoma 20 years ago, initially involving a right loin excision and subsequent lymph node metastasis in the left groin, requiring chemotherapy.  Subsequent diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the left kidney, treated with partial nephrectomy and complete nephrectomy. 

**Current Findings:** 

*   Patient reports a recent chest X-ray revealing a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung.
*   Two computer tomography examinations of the chest were unable to conclusively rule out metastasis, initially diagnosed as an inflammatory process.
*   Following the failure of the shadow to resolve, a tumor was discovered in the right atrium. 
*   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the chest revealed a spherical tumor attached to the wall of the right atrium. The T1 weighted image revealed homogenous signal intensity and a loss of signal due to fat tissue. The tumor showed no contrast medium uptake.
*   Transthoracic echocardiography excluded heart valve dysfunction and confirmed the presence of the mass in the right atrium. 

**Diagnosis (Preoperative):** Benign lipoma in the right atrium.

**Plan:** Excision of the lipoma through incision of the right atrium, utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass support. Biopsy of the mass in the right lower lobe of the lung.

**Laboratory Results:** Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, and lab results were normal, with the exception of elevated urea and electrolytes. 

**Procedure:** Excision of the lipoma via right atrium incision, supported by cardiopulmonary bypass.

**Tumor Description:** The excised lipoma was described as walnut-sized, yellow, and smooth.
