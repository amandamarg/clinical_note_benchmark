**Subject:** Right Inguinal Hernia with Appendedicular Adhesion – Surgical Repair

**Chief Complaint:** Patient presented with a right groin bulge noted 6 weeks prior.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient reported a right groin bulge that had been present for 6 weeks. Initially associated with sharp pain at onset, but currently asymptomatic.

**Physical Examination:** Physical examination revealed a 3 cm x 3 cm firm, nontender mass in the right groin just lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Diagnostic Studies:**
*   Computed Tomography (CT) Scan: Revealed a right inguinal hernia with the appendix present within the sac.
*   Preoperative Laboratory Testing: White blood cell count of 4.7 x 10^9/L.

**Procedure:** Classic oblique incision in the right groin using the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle as landmarks. Examination revealed a hernia comprised of an extremely hard and dense amount of omentum with a chronic, scarred appearance. A relaxing incision was then made in the typical transverse fashion in the right lower quadrant through the rectus sheath, and the peritoneum entered to reduce the appendix.

**Findings:** The hernia was caused by an unknown etiology, other than no mesh implantation occurred during the original right inguinal hernia repair in 1977. The base of the appendix could be seen exiting the internal inguinal ring, but the densely adhered omentum prevented reduction of the appendix back into the peritoneal cavity.

**Postoperative Course:** No complications were encountered during the procedure.

**Recommendations:** Patient instructed to rest and avoid strenuous activity for a few weeks post-operatively. Follow-up appointment scheduled to monitor recovery and ensure proper healing.
