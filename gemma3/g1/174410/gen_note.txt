**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Aortic Dissection â€“ TEVAR

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today reporting improvement in symptoms. Patient initially presented with chest and back pain of two weeks duration unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

**Examination Findings:** Physical exam revealed stable vital signs and patient was conscious and able to move all limbs.

**Diagnostic Findings:** Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap originating from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending to the level of the renal arteries. The CTA also demonstrated enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with a large aneurysmal dilatation and a compression of the true lumen, with a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery.

**Treatment:** Patient underwent Thoracic Endovascular Repair (TEVAR) via right femoral approach with placement of a stent graft. The intimal entry tear was completely covered, and the false lumen was obliterated. 

**Post-Procedure Findings:** Postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries. 

**Disposition:** Patient was discharged one day after the procedure and was reported to be doing well. Prognosis evaluated and postoperative instructions provided. 

**Plan:** Patient will receive detailed postoperative care instructions and be scheduled for follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring.
