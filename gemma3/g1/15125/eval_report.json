Here's a breakdown of the similarities and a reason for the near-duplicate:\n\n**Identical Sections:**\n\n*   **Patient Demographics:** Both start with the patient being a 32-year-old female housewife and mother of two.\n*   **Chief Complaint:** Both describe the initial presentation \u2013 sudden onset severe headache with tonic clonic fits and loss of consciousness.\n*   **Timeline:** Both detail the 24-hour resolution without neurological deficits.\n*   **Past Medical History:** Both list the recurrent episodes, intermittent claudication, and the long-standing trivial headaches.\n*   **Physical Exam Findings:** Both report the lack of neurological deficit, impalpable radial/brachial arteries, and blood pressure discrepancies.\n*   **Investigations:** Both meticulously list *every* investigative finding:\n    *   CT Brain Scan (initial & previous) - Subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension\n    *   Laboratory Investigations - Elevated ESR and positive C Reactive Protein\n    *   Cerebral Angiography and Aortogram - Detailed findings of the carotid artery occlusion, vertebral artery aneurysm, and subclavian artery occlusion.\n*   **Treatment & Plan:** Both state the initiation of Prednisone and the referral for endovascular coil embolization.\n*   **Physician:** Both note the physician\u2019s name.\n\n\n\n**Key Difference & Why They're Similar:**\n\nThe second note describes the *outcome* of the treatment.  The first note describes the *initial presentation and investigation*.  The second note essentially reiterates the findings from the first note, but adds the unfortunate complication of a second subarachnoid hemorrhage and the patient's subsequent death during the embolization procedure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe notes are almost entirely the same except for the concluding information about the patient\u2019s death. It is clear they were likely generated from the same initial consultation and investigations."}}
