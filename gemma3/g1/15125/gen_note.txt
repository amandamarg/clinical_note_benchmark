## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient's Name]
**Age:** 32
**Date:** [Date of Note]

**Reason for Visit:** Consultation regarding recurrent episodes of neurological symptoms.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents for consultation following a recent episode of sudden onset, severe headache accompanied by generalized tonic and clonic fits and loss of consciousness. The episode resolved after 24 hours with no reported neurological deficits. Patient reports a history of similar episodes dating back one year. Prior to this recent episode, patient has experienced a long-standing history of trivial headaches, malaise, and low-grade fever for the past 6 years, without further investigation. 

**Past Medical History:** Recurrent episodes of neurological symptoms (dating back 1 year). Intermittent claudication in bilateral upper limbs.

**Social History:** Housewife and mother of two children.

**Family History:** (Not documented in conversation)

**Physical Examination:** Physical examination revealed no neurological deficit. Radial and brachial arteries were impalpable bilaterally. Blood pressure discrepancies were noted, measuring 140/80 mmHg from the right arm and 160/80 mmHg from the left arm.

**Investigations:**
*   **CT Brain Scan (Initial):** Initial CT brain scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. Previous CT brain scan (1 year prior) at initial presentation of ictus showed similar findings.
*   **Laboratory Investigations:** Elevated ESR up to 40 mm/h and positive C Reactive Protein.
*   **Cerebral Angiography and Aortogram:** Showed total occlusion of the left common carotid artery from its origin and 90% occlusion of the right common carotid artery from its origin with a slightly dilated segment prior to its tapering. Bilateral vertebral arteries were the sole arteries supplying the intracranial circulation, exhibiting a saccular basilar tip aneurysm of size 7.30 x 5.39 mm. Bilateral occlusion of subclavian arteries from their initial segments was also noted, with extensive collateral branches to intercostal arteries supplying both upper arms. The terminal aorta was irregular but bilateral renal arteries and other branches of the aorta were normal.

**Treatment:** Started on 20 mg Prednisone, resulting in a reduction of ESR and normalization of C Reactive Protein. Referred for endovascular coil embolization of the vertebral arteries due to their straight and accessible nature.

**Plan:** Follow-up appointment scheduled in one week to assess progress.
