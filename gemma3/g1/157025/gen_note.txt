**Subject:** Post-Operative Evaluation â€“ IVC Filter Complication

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient presents today with a history of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting for one day.

**Past Medical History:** Patient reports a history of DVT in the left common femoral vein at 36 weeks of pregnancy, for which an IVC filter was inserted instead of anticoagulation. Following delivery, anticoagulation therapy was initiated. Patient refused removal of the IVC filter one month after insertion.

**Vitals & Labs:** Vital signs were stable. Laboratory examination revealed mild leukocytosis. Prothrombin Time International Normalized Ratio (PT-INR) at the Emergency Room was 1.31. Patient reports not taking warfarin regularly.

**Findings:** CT scan revealed that one of the IVC filter legs had penetrated the IVC wall and caused a duodenal perforation.  An endoscopy revealed a protruding IVC filter leg in the lumen of the third portion of the duodenum, with erythema, erosion, and nodular changes observed on the duodenal mucous membrane opposite the filter. 

**Procedure:** Emergency laparotomy was performed to remove the IVC filter and repair the duodenal perforation.  During the procedure, a cannula was placed in the superior vena cava for extracorporeal circulation. The femoral artery and femoral vein were isolated for cannulation. Portions of the IVC and duodenum, including the penetrations, were isolated behind the colon. The IVC filter leg was cut and removed from the duodenum portion, and the duodenal perforation was repaired directly.

**Assessment:** Duodenal perforation secondary to IVC filter migration and penetration.
