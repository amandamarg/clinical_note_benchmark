Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key similarities and why they\u2019re so close:\n\n**1. Core Clinical Scenario:**\n\n*   **Patient Presentation:** Both describe a 33-year-old female presenting with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting due to a complication from an IVC filter.\n*   **Underlying History:** Both detail the same history: a DVT during pregnancy, insertion of an IVC filter instead of anticoagulation, patient\u2019s refusal to remove it, and subsequent anticoagulation therapy.\n*   **Complication:** Both document the critical complication \u2013 the IVC filter leg penetrating the IVC wall, leading to a duodenal perforation.\n\n**2. Detailed Findings & Procedures:**\n\n*   **CT Scan Results:** Both state the CT scan revealed the exact same findings: the filter leg penetrating the IVC, causing a duodenal perforation.\n*   **Endoscopy Findings:** Both describe the same endoscopic findings \u2013 a protruding filter leg in the duodenum with erythema, erosion, and nodular changes.\n*   **Surgical Procedure:**  Both detail the identical surgical steps: emergency laparotomy, placement of cannula for extracorporeal circulation, isolation of vessels, removal of the filter leg, and direct repair of the duodenal perforation.\n\n**3. Outcomes & Follow-Up:**\n\n*   **Ileus & Recovery:** Both mention the development of ileus and the patient\u2019s gradual recovery with a 14-day period before resuming oral intake.\n*   **Discharge & Follow-Up:** Both state the patient was discharged and is currently under follow-up.\n\n**Differences (Minor):**\n\n*   **Text 2** includes more detail regarding the IVC being densely adhered to adjacent structures.\n*   **Text 2** provides a slightly more narrative and descriptive account of the surgery.\n*   **Text 2** includes details about the patient returning to work and being under follow-up.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two texts are almost mirror images of each other, describing the same event from slightly different perspectives. They are virtually identical in terms of the clinical facts and the course of treatment. It's highly probable that one text was derived from the other."}}
