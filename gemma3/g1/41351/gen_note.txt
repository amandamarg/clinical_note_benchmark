## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - *To be filled in*]
**Date:** [Date - *To be filled in*]
**Subject:** Epicardial Pacing System Implantation â€“ Staphylococcus Aureus Infection

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents for follow-up following epicardial pacing system implantation. Patient reports a history of mild dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, and biventricular endocardial pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy with previous percutaneous endocardial pacing system implantations via the right and left subclavian veins.

**Procedure:** Patient underwent an epicardial pacing system implantation due to a Staphylococcus aureus infection of the existing endocardial pacing system. The procedure involved a lower half limited median sternotomy starting from the xiphoid process up to the level of the third intercostal space, combined with a second limited transverse sternotomy starting from the left third intercostal space and joining the midline sternotomy. The pericardium was opened in the midline, providing excellent exposure. 

*   Right atrial leads were sutured to the surface of the right atrial appendage.
*   Right ventricular bipolar leads were sutured to the anterior muscular part of the right ventricle.
*   Access to the left ventricle was achieved via gentle lifting of the heart, utilizing an epicardial tissue stabilizing system to expose the lateral wall. The left ventricular lead was secured to the proximal part of the lateral wall between the obtuse marginal arteries, with a defibrillator patch sutured to the distal lateral wall.
*   The pacing box was inserted into the sheath of the right rectus muscle, ensuring proper orientation with the patch.
*   A right subcostal incision was made to create a pocket in the lateral side of the right rectus muscle. Pacing wires were tunneled between the right hemi-diaphragm and the lateral edge of the right rectus muscle, into the pocket. Thresholds on the pacing leads were checked, and the defibrillating patch was tested. 

**Relevant Past Medical History:** Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Ventricular Tachycardia, Previous Percutaneous Endocardial Pacing System Implantations (Right and Left Subclavian Veins).

**Reason for Procedure:** Staphylococcus aureus infection of the endocardial pacing system; Subclavian vein stenosis and pacing box pocket infection precluded a transvenous approach.

**Outcome:**  Procedure successful. 

**Next Steps:** Follow-up appointment scheduled.
