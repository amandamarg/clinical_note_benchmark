Both include:\n    *   Lower half limited median sternotomy\n    *   Second limited transverse sternotomy\n    *   Pericardium opening\n    *   Suturing of atrial and ventricular leads\n    *   Use of an epicardial tissue stabilizing system\n    *   Accessing the left ventricle by lifting the heart\n    *   Securing the ventricular lead between the obtuse marginal arteries\n    *   Placement of the defibrillator patch\n    *   Insertion of the pacing box into the sheath of the right rectus muscle\n    *   Checking pacing lead thresholds\n    *   Creation of a pocket in the right rectus muscle\n    *   Tunneling of pacing wires\n*   **Outcome & Follow-up:** Both notes conclude with a successful procedure and scheduled follow-up.\n\n**Minor Differences:**\n\n*   **Specific Terminology:** There are slight variations in terminology (e.g., \u201cscrewed into\u201d vs. \u201csutured to\u201d for the ventricular lead, \u201cinterrupted stainless steel wires\u201d vs. \u201capproximated\u201d for sternum closure).\n*   **Quantitative Details:**  Text 2 provides a specific defibrillation threshold of \"< 10 Jules\", while Text 1 does not include this detail.\n*   **Flow of Description:** The presentation is slightly different; one note emphasizes the \"access\" to the left ventricle more directly, while the other focuses on the \"stabilizing system.\"\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two notes describe the *exact same procedure* performed on the same patient.  They are remarkably similar, representing almost identical clinical documentation.\n\nDo you want me to focus on a particular aspect of their similarity, such as the surgical steps or the reasons for the procedure?"}}
