**Clinical Note**

**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Evaluation of Wound Dehiscence & Hardware Exposure – Left Knee

**History of Presenting Illness:**

The patient presents to our department today for evaluation of a wound dehiscence with hardware exposure on the left knee. The patient reports persistent pain associated with the wound.

**Past Medical History:**

The patient has a history of a prior revision total hip arthroplasty performed eight years ago for severe osteoarthritis pain.  At that time, she experienced progressive pain in the affected hip, particularly with ambulation, leading to difficulties in deambulation.  An X-ray examination at that time revealed extensive femoral bone loss with displacement of the femoral component. 

Subsequently, the patient underwent a second revision total hip arthroplasty.  Eight years after the initial surgery, she presented to the orthopedics department with a femoral pseudo-tumor (bone proliferation). This led to a revision total hip arthroplasty with the insertion of a reconstruction ring with cemented dual mobility cups. 

Following the last revision, the patient experienced early symptoms of infection approximately three weeks post-operatively, including high fever, suppuration, and failure to heal. Conservative management with intravenous antibiotics, irrigation, and suction drainages was unsuccessful, leading to a planned replacement of the endoprosthesis femur in two stages. 

**Current Presentation:**

The patient was taken to the operating room for retention debridement and wound coverage with a flap. Initially, a lateral gastrocnemius flap was considered, however, due to extensive scarring and atrophic muscle, the flap was deemed unsuitable.  A free flap was ultimately selected, but vascularization was lacking and the descending genicular artery was found to be small caliber and calcified.

**Pertinent Surgical History:** 

*   Initial Total Hip Arthroplasty (74 years old)
*   Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty with reconstruction ring and cemented dual mobility cups.
*   Two-stage revision of the endoprosthesis femur following infection.

**Family Concerns:** The patient’s family expressed concern regarding her condition.
