**Subject:** Dyspnea, Hemoptysis, Mediastinal Mass

**History of Presenting Illness:**
The patient presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of worsening dyspnea and hemoptysis, reported to have begun approximately 2-3 days prior.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Mild stroke 6 years ago, with no sequelae.
*   10 years ago, patient experienced a fall down stairs, but did not seek medical attention at the time.

**Relevant Past History:**
*   Previous direct laryngoscopy revealed left vocal cord palsy, associated with difficulty speaking.
*   Prior chest CT scan showed a mediastinal mass.
*   A direct needle biopsy demonstrated inflammatory cells in the background of blood.
*   Patient reports a history of hoarseness in the past year.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
*   Initial vital signs: Pulse 86 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18 breaths/min, Blood Pressure 135/80 mmHg.
*   Auscultation revealed a continuous murmur in the left sternal and pulmonic area, along with decreased breathing sounds in the left hemithorax.

**Imaging Findings:**
*   Chest X-ray: Large density in the mediastinum and left-sided pleural effusion.
*   Echocardiography: Normal left ventricle, dilated right-sided chambers with supravalvular pulmonic stenosis.
*   Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography: Revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the distal aortic arch with clot formation and compression of the main and left pulmonary artery.
*   Chest CT Scan with Contrast and Angiographic Construction: Confirmed a 45 mm x 37 mm pseudoaneurysm in the lateral side of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian origin with a 9.5 cm x 10 cm hematoma in the mediastinum.


**Intervention:**
The patient initially refused surgical intervention, but subsequently developed severe chest pain and agreed to a surgical plan.  The patient underwent left thoracotomy via femorofemoral bypass, with a subsequent detection of a large pseudoaneurysm of the distal aortic arch.

**Additional Findings:**
*   Preoperative selective coronary angiography via the right radial artery was normal.

**Plan:**
Follow-up appointment scheduled to monitor progress.
