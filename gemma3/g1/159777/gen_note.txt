**Chief Complaint:** Patient presents with a growth in the oral cavity, specifically the right mandibular alveolar region, which has been present for approximately 1.5 years. This growth is causing difficulty with complete mouth closure and chewing.

**History of Present Illness:** Patient reports noticing a small, painless growth within the oral cavity approximately 1.5 years ago. The growth has gradually increased in size and is now significantly impacting function, causing difficulty with mouth closure and chewing. Patient also reports a persistent, fetid odor emanating from the oral cavity for the past few months.

**Past Medical History:** Patient has a history of exfoliation of mandibular and maxillary teeth due to extensive mobility.

**Referral:** Patient was referred to our outpatient department of maxillofacial surgery following a consultation at a dental education camp held in his village.

**Allergies:** Patient reports no known drug allergies.

**Other Medical History:** Patient reports moderate visual and hearing impairment.

**Physical Examination:** 
*   Upon protrusion of the tongue, a slightly visible growth was noted.
*   Oral examination revealed a smooth surfaced, lobulated growth measuring approximately 5 x 4 x 2 cm, located on the alveolar ridge from the midline to the molar region on a completely edentulous alveolar ridge. The growth is pedunculated and freely movable over the peduncle, which is present on the alveolar ridge of the premolar region. The surface of the growth is smooth and shows normal color in certain areas, whereas the superior surface of the growth in certain areas is covered by yellowish plaque-like material. There is a mild indentation of the maxillary teeth.

**Plan:** 
*   Biopsy will be performed to determine the etiology of the growth.
*   Antibiotics prescribed to address the persistent fetid odor.
