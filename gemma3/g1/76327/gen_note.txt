## Clinical Note

**Patient:** [Patient Name - To be filled in]
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Subject:** Evaluation for Fatigue and Shortness of Breath

**History of Present Illness:** Patient presents today complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath for the past two months, exacerbated by physical activity. Patient denies chest pain, heart palpitations, or fainting spells.

**Exam Findings:**
*   **Vitals:** BP 148/66 mmHg, Pulse 48 bpm.
*   **Cardiac Exam:** Auscultation revealed an S4 sound and cannon A waves in the jugular vein.
*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Current ECG shows complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm at 49 bpm and a right bundle branch block. Review of ECG from 3 months ago revealed an underlying conduction disease with a prolonged PR interval and right bundle branch block while in sinus rhythm.

**Diagnostic Testing:**
*   **Trans-thoracic Echocardiography:** Normal heart size and function. Mild degenerative changes noted in the mitral and aortic valves – consistent with age.
*   **Laboratory Results:** No evidence of metabolic or ischemic problems.

**Diagnosis:** Age-related degenerative conduction disease.

**Plan:**
Due to the complete heart block and junctional escape rhythm, a permanent pacemaker is recommended to address the symptomatic heart block.  We will also evaluate for possible coronary artery disease given the patient’s symptoms.  We will proceed with pacemaker implantation.  During the procedure, we anticipate potential difficulty accessing the right ventricular cavity due to a persistent left superior vena cava.

**Next Steps:** Obtain informed consent for pacemaker implantation. Schedule procedure.
